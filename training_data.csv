Walking in, it does seem like a throwback to 30 years ago, old fashioned menu board, booths out of the 70s, and a large selection of food. Their speciality is the Italian Hoagie, and it is voted the best in the area year after year. I usually order the burger, while the patties are obviously cooked from frozen, all of the other ingredients are very fresh. Overall, its a good alternative to Subway, which is down the road.",0,5UmKMjUEUNdYWqANhGckJw,0,4,2012-08-01,review,0

CONS: The pizza was not good.  Pre-formed crust, NOT fresh dough.  The price of the failure of a pizza WAS NOT CHEAP EITHER.

qEE5EvV-f-s7yHC0Z4ydJQ,AEyiQ_Y44isJmNbMTyoMKQ,"First the only reason this place could possibly win best hoagie is because there's no competition. Two hoagies and a side of onion rings cost $25.74

So I'm thinking with the reader choice awards and $10 per 12"" hoagie these will be awesome. 

I was sadly mistaken. 

The only reason I didn't give one star is because is the bread & dressing is fairly decent. 

So on to the hoagies, the Italian is general run of the mill. Minimal meat and a ton of shredded lettuce. You get more meat at subway. Nothing really special & NOT worthy of the $10 price tag. 

Second, the steak hoagie, it is atrocious. 
No cheese?!?!? You have to add cheese for $1 so now the steak hoagie is $11. That has so little amounts of meat that I thought I was eating a lettuce & onion hoagie. I am thoroughly disappointed with this hoagie, possibly the worst value of a hoagie I've ever eaten. 
I'm not say eating at subway is any better, but for the huge price difference you are better off doing so. 
Check out pasquales down the road, better hoagie & price.",0,5UmKMjUEUNdYWqANhGckJw,0,2,2016-04-08,review,1
jBoH6qKGO7wdYyg_YjBcQA,V-bqYx62zpxfH2oFkzXPzw,"Normally, I do not do reviews of an establishment unless the rating is exceptionally great or exceptionally bad.  If I had not felt sucker punched and mugged after I left Mr. Hoagie, I would not be writing this bad review.  On my first and last trip there, I paid $24.59 for two whole hoagies.  

1) The Italian (ordered because the woman (she) working there told me it was their most popular hoagie) I ordered with lettuce and onions (no tomato, italian dressing which all come free with the hoagie).  I had to pay $1 to add cheese to the hoagie.  Because I was traveling and would not be eating the hoagie right away, I asked for the italian on the side.  She told me there was a charge for the dressing on the side.  I passed on that on principle.  Are you kidding me?  I just saved her money by declining the tomato.  I was not going to pay for the dressing on the side.  At this point, I am certain something is not right and this place appears to me to be in financial trouble.  That pales in comparison to what happened next.  I opened the hoagie and there were three microscopically thin slices of meat on this hoagie.  Ham, salami, and bologna.  Bologna!?!?!?!?    Who in the hell puts disgusting bologna on an Italian hoagie?  That disqualifies that hoagie as an Italian.  The red flags indicating this place is in financial trouble are blinding my view.  One area of this hoagie only had one slice of bologna, no ham and no salami.

2)  The Steak hoagie came with nothing on it but lettuce, tomato, onions, and dressing.  I ordered it without lettuce, tomato, onions, or dressing.  I asked for mayo on the side.  I had to pay for that so I declined.  Are you kidding me?  I just saved them money by passing on the lettuce, tomato, fresh onions, and dressing!  I paid $3 to add sautéed mushrooms, onions, and cheese.  Here we go again.  Canned mushrooms that were not even cooked through (were still cold) and onions that were still crunchy/undercooked.  News flash:  you need to serve fresh mushrooms that have been sautéed (canned mushrooms are another sign this place is in financial trouble).  I literally had to open the hoagie to find the steak because I could not taste or see it.  The hoagie was 50% mushrooms, 30%onions, 10% cheese and 10% steak.

I could have personally made 10 whole hoagies with substantial quality ingredients and toppings for the $24.59 I paid for these two whole hoagies.  I intentionally patronize non-chain restaurants to support small businesses.  In this case, Never. Again.  (The hoagie bun was better than average.)

We have heard that their wings are great and decided it was finally time to check it out. Their wings are whole wings and crispy, which is a nice change of pace. I got their wet Cajun sauce and garlic butter wings. The Cajun did not have a bold enough flavor for me and their sauce is too thin. The sauce was also thin for the garlic butter, but that is more expected. They were better than average, but I don't like seeing all the sauce resting at the bottom of the boat.

It's like hitting out of US Open type rough...not very amenable to practicing.

Decent mats, clean balls and accessible hours.  Hell you need even less people now with the advent of the machine that doles out the balls.  This place has none of them.  It is april and there are no grass tees yet.  BTW they opened for the season this week although it has been golfing weather for a month.  The mats look like the carpet at my 107 year old aunt Irene's house.  Worn and thread bare.  Let's talk about the hours.  This place is equipped with lights yet they only sell buckets of balls until 730.  It is still light out.  Finally lets you have the pit to hit into.  When I arrived I wasn't sure if this was a driving range or an excavation site for a mastodon or a strip mining operation.  There is no grass on the range. Just mud.  Makes it a good tool to figure out how far you actually are hitting the ball.  Oh, they are cash only also.

Bottom line, this place sucks.  The best hope is that the owner sells it to someone that actually wants to make money and service golfers in Pittsburgh.",0,cE27W9VPgO88Qxe4ol6y_g,0,1,2013-04-18,review,1

It's a fairly big range - if you are familiar with Scally's in Moon, it seems like it has almost as many tees, though its not nearly as nice a facility. 

The guys in the pro shop were two of the friendlier guys I've come across at ranges or at courses. Yards were indeed marked and there are some targets to aim for, and even some hazards to aim away from. 

A big red flag to me was the extra charge ($3) to hit off the grass. I am no range expert, but this is the 4th one I've been to and the first I've seen of that sort of nickel and diming....

Price for the golf balls was reasonable and I do plan to be back every week until they close up in October for the season. Hopefully, since its for sale, it will reopen as a golf facility again.",0,cE27W9VPgO88Qxe4ol6y_g,0,4,2013-08-16,review,0

My parents saw a recommendation to visit this place from Rick Sebak's ""25 Things I Like About Pittsburgh"" and he's usually pretty accurate.  His recommendations were to try the Reuben, Fish Sandwich and Open-Faced Steak Sandwich.  We went early afternoon for a late lunch today (a Saturday) and were seated right away.  The staff is extremely friendly.  My Mom & I each had the fish sandwich, while my Dad & Brother had a Reuben sandwich.  The fish was very good, but the Reuben was to die for!  Both dishes were massive, and could very easily be shared between two people.  On top of being extremely large portions, it was incredibly affordable.  The giant fish sandwich was $8 and the giant Reuben was $7.50.  Our drinks were always filled and we were checked on several times during the meal.  We will definitely be back!!!

Its been there ages, and looks it. If you're all about ambiance, don't bother. If you pretend you're in a movie set in Pittsburgh 30 years ago it works pretty well. The service is sometimes hit or miss. Most of girls are good, one is very slow, one is amazing. They are all friendly and usually a few different people will check in to make sure that you're happy. Everything is made fresh so be prepared that nothing comes flying out of that kitchen - busy times it can take a good while to get food.

-Salmon (huge and delicious)
-Flounder
-Shrimp a few ways (""Norfolk"" style is oily for my taste, and I never had it growing up in Norfolk.)

tAKjY3bQXH51msJbOHYPmQ,uf61rPucuICXhSPXlZ1hIQ,"After a morning of Thrift Store hunting, a friend and I were thinking of lunch, and he suggested Emil's after he'd seen Chris Sebak do a bit on it and had tried it a time or two before, and I had not. He said they had a decent Reuben, but to be prepared to step back in time.

Well, seeing as how I'm kind of addicted to late 40's and early 50's, and the whole Rat Pack scene, stepping back in time is a welcomed change in da burgh...as long as it doesn't involve 1979, which I can see all around me every day.

And yet another shot at finding a decent Reuben in da burgh...well, that's like hunting the Holy Grail. So looking under one more bush certainly wouldn't hurt.

So off we go right at lunchtime in the middle of...where exactly were we? At first I thought we were lost, driving around a handful of very rather dismal looking blocks in what looked like a neighborhood that had been blighted by the building of a highway. And then...AHA! Here it is! And yep, there it was. This little unassuming building with an add-on entrance with what looked like a very old hand painted sign stating quite simply 'Emil's. 

We walked in the front door, and entered another world. Another time, and another place. Oh, and any Big Burrito/Sousa foodies might as well stop reading now. I wouldn't want to see you walk in, roll your eyes and say 'Reaaaaaalllly?'

This is about as old world bar/lounge/restaurant as it gets. Plain, with a dark wood bar on one side, plain white walls with no yinzer pics, good sturdy chairs and actual white linens on the tables. This is the kind of neighborhood dive that I could see Frank and Dino pulling a few tables together for some poker, a fish sammich, and some cheap scotch. And THAT is exactly what I love.

Oh...but good food counts too. 

We each had a Reuben, and my friend had a side of fries. The Reubens were decent, but not NY awesome. A little too thick on the bread, but overall, tasty and definitely filling. Not too skimpy on the meat. I seriously CRAVE a true, good NY Reuben, but since I can't afford to travel right now, what I find in da burgh will have to do. But as we sat and ate, burgers came out to an adjoining table. Those were some big thick burgers. A steak went past for the table behind us. That was HUGE! And when we asked about it, the waitress said 'Yeah, it's huge and really good, and he only charges $12.99 for it, ain't that nuts?' Another table of five came in, and wham. Fish sandwiches PILED with breaded fish that looked amazing. Yeah, I want that, that, that and THAT!

My friend also mentioned that they have a Chicken Parm special one day of the week that is only served UNTIL 4 pm, and that it is fantastic. If only I could GET there on that week day before 4...

The waitress did a good job, especially since there was quite a growing crowd at lunchtime on a Saturday, and only one of her. She kept up and was very friendly. 

They only have Pepsi products, so I had a brewed iced tea, which was very fresh, and she did pop by to ask about refills as often as she could. As the lunch hour went on, they were getting busy.

Emil's is no frills, good portions, very reasonable prices, VERY comfortable neighborhood hole in the wall...kind of like Cheers, but in a blue collar neighborhood in the 1950's. Fan-freakin-tastic! I could feel at home here.

You definitely want to hit Mapquest or plug in your GPS though. I am not sure that I could find it again on my own...it really is a hidden gem. I will be making my friend take me back until I can memorize where the heck it is.

Addendum: 2nd visit for the fish sandwich. Excellent. Truly. A pound of fish on a fish-shaped bun (as opposed to da burgh's seemingly popular hamburger bun). The fish was flavorful, the batter excellent, and for just $8. This may have been the best fish sandwich I've yet to have in da burgh.",2,mVHrayjG3uZ_RLHkLj-AMg,0,5,2014-11-03,review,3

k0a-uii8yr__Rl-9ipl_RA,e11K8g-0m66gDeRz3TgSIQ,"I had a hankering for some fried fish tonight and the fish fry at Maximilian Kolbe was going to close before I got home on the bus, and I suggested to my wife and 12 year-old daughter that we try Emil's lounge as WQED's Rick Seback loved the place as did Andrew Zimmern when he visited for the Bizarre Foods America episode featuring Pittsburgh.  

The place is in Rankin - a rough around the edges town in the Mon Valley between Swissvale and Braddock.  Don't be put off at first - the outside doesn't have much decoration to speak of and looks like the sort of place that you might think twice about it.  A TGI Fridays it isn't... And thank god for that.

The place is well-kept but a little dated -  no fripperies here.  But we're not here for the Decor - we're here for some dinner.  

The menu is basic with reasonable prices.  The meats and seafood are high quality and everything is made to order.  Their stuffed cabbage is regarded as the best in  Pittsburgh.  I love stuffed cabbage but I just made a batch a couple of weeks ago and I'm cabbaged out.  Their Ruebens are   also killer (our waitress raved about them).  My wife and I both settled on fish sandwiches.  These are true Pittsburgh fish Sammiches - fresh fried fish in crispy breading, crammed between enormous pillows of soft, yet chewy and crispy Mancini's Italian bread.  No adornments - just a boatload of hot crispy fish.  Emil's uses thick cod fillets piled high rather than a thin fillet that needs to be broken up to fit in the bun.  Truly a great sandwich.  My daughter had the BLT - looked good and on good bread and they weren't skimpy with the bacon.

The service was very pleasant and friendly and the crowd was a great group of folks.  We all had fun with 4 other tables when my wife pulled up a Trivial Pursuit game on her iPhone and pretty much everyone joined in and had a good laugh.

Don't expect ambiance, but if you're hungry and want nice wait staff, (usually family) squeaky clean, great value and generous portions-way more than I can ever finish, Emil's is your place.

Tonight I had a cup of the chicken dumpling soup that was sooooo good! Very obviously home made. I had a side of onion rings that were perfectly cooked, which doesn't sound fancy, but I still couldn't finish. My husband had the chicken parm. Thursday is Italian night. It came with a huge salad, very fresh, an entire loaf of Italian bread, and a generous portion of nicely crisped and tender chicken breasts. Added to that, a side helping of ziti. My husband enjoyed it very much, the chicken was perfectly cooked. I'm a sauce snob, Italian, allergic to with an aversion to green peppers. To me, there was just a hint of green pepper in the sauce so I probably would avoid anything with red sauce at Emil's but that's just my quirk. I've had the stuffed cabbages there, the fried fish, Ruebens, burgers - all wonderful! Emil was and his family is of Serbian decent. Food is love.

I went to check this place out on the way home from the airport one Friday night and it didn't disappoint. It is refreshing to walk into a townie bar and not feel like the music stops and everyone in the place is staring at you - I'm guessing the mixed crowd of older hockey fans, young men in collared shirts, and thirtysomethings have probably seen it all during their time at this place. 

The staff was top notch - the orders were somewhat overwhelming as they appeared short-staffed for the night, but my waitress tried to keep a positive attitude for my entire visit. The other waiter was wearing a hooded cardigan, and I wanted to steal it from him due to my difficulty in finding such a quality article of clothing.

We ordered a white pizza - large in size, engulfed in cheese, full of garlic flavor, flavorful hot sausage. An overall delicious pizza, aside from 2 things: 1, way too much grease (I know this comes with the territory, but still, it is sometimes unbearable); 2, CANNED MUSHROOMS - the worst thing to come out of a can. Ever. I would rather eat canned Alpo than canned mushrooms. And if the mushrooms weren't canned, they were just the worst mushrooms I've ever consumed. The mushroom debacle is enough to lower the review by an entire star - disgusting!

My advice for the place is keep everything awesome - random music from the jukebox, tasty food, great prices, good crowd and staff - and get some decent mushrooms; why they spoil an otherwise above average pie with such inferior crap, I'll never know.",1,KayYbHCt-RkbGcPdGOThNg,1,4,2011-02-27,review,0

We ordered within 5 minutes of sitting down, there couldn't have been more than 20 people in the place, counting the people on the patio.  Took them almost 40 minutes to serve 3 sandwiches and a salad. I tried the fish sandwich, came out fried extra crispy on the ends, if there is such a thing as fish jerky a third of the sandwich would have qualified, it was just ok. I've had better at almost any church that fries fish during Lent. 

All 3 of my dinner companions left partial sandwiches  or salad uneaten. Bread french fries and onion rings were good though. Iced tea was good, though I've never seen a place dispense sweet n low like they were giving away their last rock of crack. Asked for sugar but never saw any, they don't carry any other artificial sweeteners besides the pink stuff.

I may give the place another try in the future for a Reuben or hamburger, assuming today was some aberration possibly due to a cook having a family emergency or something like that.

I opted for their Friday special a fish sandwich with cheese, hold the cheese.  I hate cheese on fish, in my mind it doesn't go well together.  It came with one side and chips.  I opted for cole slaw because that does go great with fish.  The chips were straight out of a bag.  I am not a chip fan, especially not one that Lay's delivered.  It would have been nice to have homemade chips.  The special was 10.50, so I was hoping it would be good.

The wait wasn't terrible for as busy as they were, but if you're on a strict time schedule for lunch I'd call ahead.  The food arrived in about 20 minutes.  My fish sandwich though nice size was a little small for the price, compared to other's that are cheaper.  The slaw was nice, good flavor but the fish was average.  I loaded it up with some tarter and cocktail sauce to help the flavor out.  It wasn't a bad sandwich just a tad small and mediocre for the price.

nEYPahVwXGD2Pjvgkm7QqQ,nkquD2FJgZvyj3bcobqlrg,"I will start by saying we have a nice new deck. That is where the good part ends.

Why two stars if we have a nice deck now? Well, it all started in May when we had a man named Al come out and talk to us about the process. He was a true salesman, I'll tell you that. Not a straight shooter, but an excited salesman that wanted to sell... And we bought into it.

He told us they were backed up with the harsh winter and a lot of jobs, but they could probably start by June 24th. Mind you, this was the end of May we met with him. He said they would have to do a survey of our land and get a permit from Dormont before they started. We felt confident in going with them, and booked it.

Here's where things fell apart. Weeks went by with no word from them on the process. Finally I called and left messages. Al finally got in touch with me and the conversation was utterly confusing. He must have not understood me because he just kept talking in circles. So I hung up not knowing what was going on. Finally I called back and the admin told me that the survey could take a couple weeks to come back. I wish Al would have told us that.

So our June 24th date came and went. We finally got our survey. And they were quick to bill us for it, but no word on where we were in the process. I called back a couple times with no real answers from the admin. Apparently they were now waiting for the permit from Dormont.

A month later, I was frustrated and asked to speak with someone at the company. I spoke with someone who told me that Dormont usually takes a week to process the permit, but we were now going on a month. He told me he would bug the guy about it and we finally got it. 

I completely understand that waiting on the permit is not their fault, but why no communication about it? Just call me and tell me they're waiting for the permit, but they'll work towards asking Dormont what the hold up is. Seems simple.

Finally we get the permit and work is supposed to start. Tuesday comes and they have to wait for approval from Dormont on holes they're digging. So holes are dug and equipment is put in my backyard and then nothing happens for two days. Where did everyone go? Who knows, because I wasn't informed! 

I was upset and contacted the company owner, Dave, by email. I told him how frustrated I was about the lack of communication. He wrote me two sentences that  said ""there will be acres there tomorrow morning to finish and most will be done tomorrow."" Well, that didn't happen.

Then two other dudes show up two days later and did work for about three hours and left. The main guy comes back the next day and says they did it wrong. So apparently the part about how they wouldn't need access to my house changes to they're drilling bolts into my house to secure he deck. 

Finally, the second week into construction, my tiny 10x11 foot deck is done. It was upsetting that they left the deck dirty, and all the dirt and cement they moved around wasn't cleaned up. I even asked them to fill all the holes they dug up and didn't use, and they only filled up one. When you create a construction project, isn't it just good business to clean it up and make it look nice? Didn't happen here.

My main point is, contractors have a reputation for not being the most trustworthy. Why be that company? Why not be an upstanding company that consumers can trust? My main issues with them were that things were not communicated to me properly up front, nor was the ongoing process communicated to me. Then they left everything unfinished in my eyes, leaving the site dirty. I understand things happen and things get delayed, but just email or call me. It's not that hard to keep me updated, it is 2014 with a million ways to be contacted.

Even though I have a nice deck (after I clean things up myself!), I would not recommend them to anyone.",1,3ZVKmuK2l7uXPE6lXY4Dbg,0,2,2014-08-06,review,10

I have worked as a vet tech in a previous job and have had experiences at numerous facilities here in Pittsburgh and Greentree Animal Clinic blows them all out of the water. Key things that you should note about this place:
* They do not over charge
* They only recommend services/things that they genuinely believe will help your pet, not their bottom line and they do not pressure you in any way
* They are respectful and genuine to you and your pet which is hard to come by nowadays
* Everyone from the front desk to the techs, to the vets are kind, patient and understanding. No condescension or poor attitudes, just positive vibes all around. 
* Dr Brown goes above and beyond any vet I've ever met. He has shown so much care, professionalism,  kindness and knowledge that I will gladly refer anyone with a pet to him because I know they will be in good hands and his fellow vets (Dr Reuther, Dr Kelley, and Dr Mann)  are just as phenomenal.

Shortly after returning home she started to cough and gag like.  I watched her for a couple hours do this and then called the vet to see if maybe she was having an allergic reaction to the medicine they gave her.  She was very uncomfortable.  I asked if they though she needed to come back to the office.  The dr told me that it sounded like she was overheated and to put cold towels on her.  I told him that I didn't think that was the problem because she hadn't been out.  At this point they were open and would be for another hour.   Two hours later I was at a vet hospital with them telling me she is suffering from a heart problem and that they really couldn't do anything for her.  WHAT?!?!  So I found myself having to put her down.  Fast forward to now.  I have a 14 wk puppy that has blood in its stool. They have not seen her yet. I bring in a sample.  Wait 24 hrs.  They leave a message that it's positive and to call for an appt.  I call. She has to wait 4 days to be seen.  WHAT?!?!?   Obviously my pups are out of there for good!

Yes, the owners manual was in the glove box, but there was way too much reading involved, and I learn quicker by hands on training.

Very nice people work here, I was happy to find that even though they had closed a section, the server was willing to stay longer to serve us our dinner.

We chatted with the server a little bit -- she was quite engaging -- and then moved on to order our meal:

Tea
Pepsi
Open-faced Hot Turkey Sandwich with mashed potatoes and gravy
Buffalo Chicken strips with mashed potatoes and macaroni n' cheese

Our drinks arrived and our server conversed with us some more about the area.  She would leave every couple of minutes to check on our food and to make certain that her other tables had everything they needed.  Eventually, our entrees arrived -- both piping hot.  I went straight for the macaroni and cheese.  It didn't taste bad, but I swear that it is made by Stouffers.  I didn't feel the need to eat that much knowing that there were other things to eat.  I tried the mashed potatoes and found that they too came from a package; but, again, they didn't taste bad with the brown gravy.  I moved on to the main part of my meal -- the buffalo chicken strips.  At least they were all white meat and the buffalo sauce was more than just mild.  I contented myself with eating them.  

I tried some of the hot turkey sandwich and just left the rest for my friend since it was not fresh cut turkey but instead luncheon meat that had been heated.

tAKjY3bQXH51msJbOHYPmQ,MsoASFxCmOOkOBOqZ80ngQ,"Two meals, on the recommendation of a friend who lives near the place, and after the second trip, I was compelled to write. 'Rocky' would definitely describe the experiences.

On the first trip, I went to try their (at that time)raved about Reuben. And YET to find a true good Reuben in da burgh, I tried it.

Well, they were out of the proper bread, and the guy had to run to the store to buy the closest thing he could find, which was not the proper bread, and instead of one of their 'raved about' Reubens, I received two mini-Reubens, which basically took the guts from one Reuben, and spread it out onto two sandwiches on regular sized bread. I ate it. It wasn't great, but they swore it was because they'd run out of the bread. Bread or not, it still wasn't great. The atmosphere was pleasant in that 'blue collar bar' kind of way, and the staff was very nice, but not a winning pitch on the Reuben.

The second trip was after a long day of moving furniture with the same friend. Sat in the back room, instead of the bar, which felt more like a restaurant, of course, with the big screen TV covering the sports of the moment.

I was in the mood for dinner this time, and after a scan, decided on fried chicken and mashed potatoes with the salad bar. My friend ordered one of her faves, the breaded pork chops.

We hit the salad bar, which was uber-basic. Three soups (mostly vegetable loaded, which left me out), basic iceberg lettuce mix (very probably out of a bag), a few veggie toppings, and three or four dressings. It was a basic salad, no big deal. More or less an appetizer filler before the meal.

The mind-blower in this trip was the ordering of the fried chicken dinner. Our waiter looked like a 19 year old gas station attendant, skinny little blonde guy with a sweet but incredibly naive face, and an air of vapidity, which was confirmed when I placed my order. I asked what chicken pieces came in the dinner, and asked if it was possible to only get dark meat. I never imagined how confusing a question that could possibly be. It literally took him two trips back to the kitchen to 'ask', and the child honestly had no clue what 'white meat' and 'dark meat' meant. The first answer he came back with was that the chicken came in a pre-portioned prepared bag, kind of Kentucky Fried Chicken style...which didn't answer my question, thus prompting the second trip. 

After the second trip back I heard the cook holler 'Tell him I'll fix him up'. 

Well, the chicken was prepackaged dreck like you'd find in the freezer case of Walmart, tiny and not good, and the potatoes had that slight tinge of chem-spuds flavor, laden with some kind of chopped up green (parsley?), and a side of that basic brown gravy served up in 5 gallon buckets.

Thank goodness for the basic salad bar.

Even my friend admitted that her pork chops were different and not what she'd expected. They also appeared to be from a freezer bag.

The irony was that the boy who didn't know white meat from dark meat, was chatting with some other customers...about baseball...and he was a genius about the mindless sport of baseball. Ahhhh da burgh.

Third base? Nah...why bother when there are so many other options around. Go on in a grab a beer and chat black and gold if you happen to be in Carnegie...they can help you out all types of ways in that area. Just don't go hungry if you actually have tastebuds.

A friend of mine who lived in the area recommended Rocky's.  As I walked in the door I was pleasantly approached by the server and shown a table. It was clean, welcoming and the lounge was busy. It was Friday night and the special was the fish fry.  I ordered the fish and in the meantime I sipped on a draft brew.  The order was delivered to my table in no time.  The fish and sides were tasty and the portion size was large. As I was watching the game and enjoying the heck out of my dinner I noticed a dessert case with a nice selection of cakes.  Well needless to say I got a togo box for what was left of my dinner and ordered a slice of cheesecake.  Another good choice!

This place is a neighborhood standard that for some reason compels you to return, even if your experience was less than stellar. Fancy it is not. Gourmet it is definitely not. Every item on the menu seems to come from a can, bag ,bucket or box. The wait staff is often clueless and changes like the wind. I have never had the same server twice. But the fact is you get a decent meal for a decent price and always have a little to take home. Yes, the salad bar is very basic. Not every item is a fresh as it should be. The iced tea often takes on the taste of Lord knows what. However,  the fried fish dinner is one of the best I have had anywhere in Picksburg. Their meatloaf is terrific as are several of their hoagies. In a nutshell, this place has a lot of flaws. Like we all do. A few upgrades like a better wait staff, fresh gravy instead of their gallon bucket brand, homemade sauce instead of whatever canned stuff they are using would jump this review to 5 stars.

I can appreciate that some smaller businesses might have trouble installing a credit card system in their store/resturant, but could you perhaps provide an ATM?  In the past, this would deter me from eating at this place. 

Looking at a standard breakfast menu, I decided to go with a tuna melt instead. What I got was a cold tuna salad sandwich with a slice of cheese on toast. I had ordered a melt being in the mood for a warm meal, but to no avail. One day later I can't even remember what my side was. I suppose it didn't leave much of an impression on me.  I have to say that the dessert was really good! The cherry pecan pie! I have not seen this concoction anywhere else but this was awesome!

Well, faithful followers, I must now admit that The Dor-Stop has now been verified as only one of the best.  Why?  That's because Gab and Eat I have now found to be THE best breakfast I've ever had.  If it was closer to my home I would quickly become a regular.

I easily decided to order the Mixed Grill (Half).  Before I go on, I must ask...has anyone seen a full order?  Because I honestly can't imagine how much food that is.  I created my own with bacon, cheese, eggs and potatoes.  Based on reviews I also opted to get a side of the sausage and was pleased as punch when our waitress asked if I wanted hot or sweet....or one of each.  I like variety, so I jumped on the change to try both.  I also selected the Italian toast - what other kind is there, really?  

When my food arrived, it looked delicious.  There was so much bacon that after eating half of my Mixed Grill it looked like I'd barely started.  The sausage was great, just don't ask me which one I liked best.  My toast?  4 thick slices that looked to be about half the loaf and were buttered on both sides. It was a struggle, but I was determined to enjoy every tasty morsel and not leave a crumb.   

In case anyone is wondering, yes, they use real butter.  I saw pounds of it stacked in the kitchen with my own two eyes.  The wait staff was quick and efficient as well as helpful and friendly with our larger group of 9 people.  The fact that none of the plates match and I noticed a sign at the front register that said, ""We need mugs"" just makes me love this place even more.

GYSqprhDteK52ILOBaFCIQ,S-Y34-9ujttt9UOm6QjD7A,"On our current road trip of baseball, brews, hockey and diners, we decided to try Gab & Eat based on yelpers rating putting it #1 for breakfast in Pittsburgh area. We have to agree with most other reviewers that this is a place to eat.
We arrived around noon on Saturday and were happy there were a couple open tables. The place is tucked at the end of a strip mall and you have to look to find it. There is plenty of parking.
Inside the decor is quaint and funky at the same time. Country style decorations and signs are mixed with nostalgia signs & posters. Most interesting are all the signatures and comments written on the wall by past customers. We regretted not having a marker to add ours. The other highlight was three large white boards with trivia questions - fun way to spend time waiting for food.
The waitstaff there is...uh, experienced. They are attentive, pleasant and efficient.
After reading reviews I had to try the Mixed Grill. But S went with pancakes with a side of bacon. The pancakes were outstanding...maybe the best either of us has eaten. They were thick but with light texture and rich flavor. 
His bacon was cooked just as requested - as crisp as possible - and very flavorful.
The Mixed Grill is a mixed together concoction of eggs, potatoes, onions, peppers, cheese, and spicy Italian sausage grilled together. I'm glad I heeded those who stressed going with the half size order. It filled a full sized dinner plate with a heaping order. I couldn't finish it all and that's rare. How do they serve the whole potion -- in a trough?
Everything was cooked well. The sausage added a nice bite to offset the somewhat plain potatoes. You can build your own mix but the basic was a good mix.
My only complaint was the amount of potato and that they are pretty plain. I like home fries with lots of seasoning that have aged on the grill. These potatoes were pretty uniform chunks with little seasoning. Personal preference.
It usually comes with Italian toast but they were out so I went with raisin. It was delicious soft inch thick slices.
Coffee was excellent and the cup stayed full. The total was less than $15. Fabulous value for the quality and portions.
While I can't say it's the best breakfast in Pittsburgh (only here 3 days), its the best so far and one of the best we've had.",1,b9WZJp5L1RZr4F1nxclOoQ,0,5,2013-04-13,review,1
Dg9xy4ZbsteCBUL_sjaNKA,LTHhgovWBAXquOrDVKx3Yw,"Met my nephew for lunch in Carnegie and he suggested Gab & Eat.   Way to go Justin!  The restaurant is in a strip mall across from the Dairy Queen.  The grill is right up front so you can see them cooking.   They have counter space for eating and tables/booths for 4.   Don't expect to sit at one table if you have more than 4. They have a great looking breakfast menu.   We all got burgers of varying kinds!  They were tasty!   The buns were buttered, toasted and soft.  Yum!   the amount of butter didnt bother me  but it did my whiny mother. Who whined even though there is a no whining sign as you walk in the door.   We ordered fresh cut fries as onion rings.  Both of which were great.  The half order was plenty and a nice option to a full order.   The restaurant was full of local men at lunch which is usually a good sign.  I give it a 4 star only because of the waitress who kind of threw straws, silverware and napkins at us as she walked behind the counter.  At least she didn't throw the food when it came!   She also served the fries and Onion rings way before our burgers came out which was kind of weird.   They were nice and hot but would have been cold had we waited for the burgers.   It didn't factor into my four star rating but I deduct a star from nephew because he invited us out to lunch then allowed me pay!   Just kidding Justin!

It's still just OK. We didn't have to wait this time (Saturday morning at 10:30), but there was a wait throughout the time we were there. The menu is very basic- no specialty pancakes, waffles, or french toast and only 1 specialty omelette. There were no meal options, so if you want home fries or something, it's extra. The omelettes do include toast. (Great bread, btw!) We had to wait a while for our food, which was surprising because we've been to a lot of diners. My husband and I both got omelettes and agreed that the contents were not really cooked with the egg. It's almost like the egg was completely cooked and someone threw the cooked contents in there and just folded it over. As for my mushroom and cheese omelette, the cheese was lacking. My biggest peev about this place is that it's CASH ONLY. Perhaps I missed it, but I'm pretty sure this wasn't noted anywhere on the menu or the front door.

Since they both came in half portions I went with those. My waitress made sure I always had a fresh cup of hot tea since I was sitting near the entrance. It seemed like a long production line to wait for your order but it did not disappoint. When I got my half orders I was overwhelmed at the size!

The waffle was thick and fluffy and the home fries which bore a resemblance to hash browns were hot and greasy. Ketchup is on the counter as well as syrup. Yes they use real butter here since I could observe one of the chefs using a giant slab of it in preparation of orders.

I definitely plan to revisit this place when I have more time to try different things. My advice would be to prepare to take home a doggy bag since they give huge portions even if they are half size.

I walk in to a nasty glare by one of the waitresses before seating myself at a table covered in advertisements and a woman throwing menus at us before walking away.
The waitress was a sweet old woman.
She was nice, but hard of hearing and unattentive.
Here's what I ordered:
Two egg whites scrambled, links, Italian toast, and a half order of home fries.
Here's what I got:
Two scrambled whole eggs, Italian toast, and home fries.
I addressed the missing links with the waitress and she asked me if I still wanted them. I was starved by this point and said yes. I heard her to go the chef and ask for them, to which the woman behind the grill screamed, ""For what? Do you have the slip? Where is it? Where does it say links?"" in a considerably nasty tone.
The eggs were mediocre, the home fries were unevenly cooked (mostly uncooked potato chunks, some practically ash), the links were so tasteless I stopped eating them as soon as I recognized I was full, but the toast was lovely.
The prices are ok, but I'd prefer a college student's hungover cooking to coming back here.

Update:
30 minutes after leaving I got a vicious headache.
500 milligrams of acetaminophen later, my headache has gotten worse, new unpleasant symptoms have come along, and I may have contracted food poisoning.

It was hot in there and I don't think they have AC. There was a fan in front, but that did little for us who where sitting in the back.

This place is cash only. I didn't see anything on my way in stating that, but I could have missed it. It doesn't say Cash Only anywhere inside or on the menu either. There is an ATM, but it has a $2 charge to use. Can't believe a place in 2016 doesn't take cards.

Probably won't ever go back since there are similar breakfast places closer to where I live that are more kid friendly, have better food and AC and accept more than just cash.",0,b9WZJp5L1RZr4F1nxclOoQ,0,1,2016-06-11,review,0

The food was decent, some was above average and some below but it was overall decent. I got pancakes, bacon and eggs. The pancakes were really good and fluffy, the home fries were simply okay and the eggs were not cooked well. My son had a burger and it was good. The coffee at this place was brewed to perfection which a appreciate. I would give the food 3/5.

The service was subpar for sure. While our waitress was a really nice girl, she wasn't on top of anything at all. Had to ask for coffee refills, had to ask for silverware, for napkins...etc. She got the order messed up and so on. I give the service 2/5.

The inside of the place had some country charm as you'd expect but want particularly cleanly. It also had a leaky roof in several places which had buckets collecting the water. A customer even tripped over the buckets and fell. I give the interior 2/5.

The prices were decent. I fed my whole family breakfast (3 of us) for $23. I give the prices 3/5.

So in summary, you can get okay food here for a rather cheap price but it is not a great place to dine in by any means. There are better diners in the area that I will patronize in the future rather than Barb's.",0,zaXDakTd3RXyOa7sMrUE1g,0,2,2014-07-19,review,1

The rooms contain a nice kitchenette area with a full sized refrigerator, sink, cabinets and two burners. There is no oven which I expected as the descriptions all state ""full kitchen"" so be aware of that. Also they do not keep the dishes, pots and pans, coffee makers, toasters or utensils in the rooms. If you want them you have to request them at the desk during check in. 

The room was clean and well maintained. Cable tv quality is spotty sometimes but not intolerable. The free wifi is usually fast.

I have no idea who gave this place high reviews but they must either own the place or be time travelers from back in the day when this place might not have sucked. The decor is tired and grimy, the place reeked of smoke, and the bartender/server was surly, to put it mildly. We went there on a Saturday night with a mind to try the Irish food. Apparently, we were out of luck. I've always thought that the secrets of restaurant success is to actually stock food for people to eat. He told us before we ordered that they had no ""pies"". No chicken pot pie, no shepherds pie, etc. So, we gamely tried to order other things. We placed our order. My wife, for example, ordered the Irish stew and he came back 5 min later telling us they were out of that and even more things for several people in our party. At that point my wife picked out a third option, ham and cabbage, only to be told again that ""they were out"". At that point, realizing that the only food to be had in the place was what was crusted on the menus, we asked to pay for our drinks and left. They actually then gave us flack for not having enough to put it on a debit card. In short, unless you like your dinner with a side of disappointment and depression, I'd probably avoid this place like the plague.

It's a tiny long bar just like the old Irish pubs. No more smoking allowed. Hurrah!!!  Same lousy service. 

My guess is that the entire place needs (no, strike that .... demands) an automated food/beverage ticketing system. None of the cooks, bartenders, or waitresses know who ordered what nor what ticket belongs to which table. It's actually pretty funny if you're not a) hungry or b) thirsty.

So I take the initiative and ask the fine upstanding gentleman what the phone number of the order-er was, phone my neighbor and discover the mistake. Rather than a thank you or a sorry, he just speeds off (breaking the speed limit on our block) to reach his destination 50 feet away.

The toppings were scarce, they used mini pepperoni and put maybe 8 on the whole pizza. The onions were huge chunks and the mushrooms were straight from a can. The worst part though was the thick doughy crust that tasted more like a fishy sourdough roll. I'm serious... It was so noticeable that it made me wonder if the dough was bad or if they for some weird reason put fish sauce in it. It was gross. 

We also ordered steak and Italian hoagies. The veggies were old and wilted, and there was no dressing on either. The Italian had deli meat that was clearly bottom of the line and not very generous.

He asks you to go change into a closet (Yes, a closet to change in with one lightbulb) BUT all my worries aside, the moment he started working on my items I knew he was the real deal. He learned from his father at the age of 14 how to sew. and he does things the correct way.  Meaning, for example-  I took in a pair of khakis all the way down to the cuff, but he seamed them up to look EXACTLY the way they were when I first bought them.  Most placed will have bulges and puckers.  The rest of my items were just as perfect.  Very inexpensive at $10 for a pair of pants to adjust the hem.  The items were done in a timely manner.

My most resent experience here was so horrible my family and I will never go back. The business is not run the way it has been in the past.  I took a dress that needed taken in in the back and around the neck. When I went to pick it up it was not even ready then to find out the next day that I was being charged $60. My family and I have been coming here for a few years and never ever spent anything even remotely close to $60 worth on alterations. My mom came down to pick up two things right before and and her total was $25... Not only are the prices extremely inconsistent when I finally got the dress the neck was still way too loose and the zipper didn't go up all the way I had to pin the dress myself and wear it with safety pins to a wedding. I was not able to get my money back because apparently ""it wasn't his fault"" and he told me not to worry about it. This is probably the worst business in Carnegie.

I ordered the General Tso's chicken, and my friends ordered the sesame chicken, crab rangoon, and another appetizer (egg rolls?).  They ordered the combo with less meat, and I ordered the one with more--the names were very similar, which I found confusing. The food took quite a while to come up (~15 min.), so I'd suggest calling ahead if you're in a rush.  While we were waiting, the woman behind the counter yelled at someone over the phone in Chinese, and then at a guy who came in to pick up food for delivery (probably the same person).

To be honest, I'm not much of a fan of Americanized Chinese cuisine (I lived in Singapore for 3 mos. and have visited Hong King and Japan); it's been awhile since I've had it, and this dish reminded me why.  I don't care for the overbearing sweetness and thickness of the sauce, nor do I care for the pre-cut meat in the dishes (I like to cut up my own meat, thank you very much), so the flavors and textures don't do much for me.  Having said that, my friends claimed this was the best Americanized Chinese fare they'd had in PGH (and they live in Squirrel Hill!), so if you're a fan of this cuisine, you can take that into consideration.

But it's not well maintained.  It's dingy and the locker rooms are abysmal, basically unusable.  There's a pretty wide range of equipment, but not enough of it to really go around.  If you're into free weights, that area is larger, but over crowded and very dungeony (personally I go for that, just saying).

The place must have a REALLY conservative owner as well, because all the TVs play FOX News all day long.  If you ask the staff for another channel, they will get around to changing it about half the time, the other half of the time you'll be ignored and forced to watch a bunch of awful talking heads tell you lies the entire time you're trying to run or lift.  Part of the problem is that the owner is cheap and not paying for cable where he can change the channel on the TVs individually.  They are linked to one box only.

The place also lets a whole ton of personal trainers basically do whatever they want.  This means that the area set aside for abdominal exercises, stretching, the rock climbing wall (which I've never once seen turned on or used) is over crowded with a punch of really out of shape people who are mostly carrying on conversations with their incredibly beefy personal trainers, because hey, the trainer is getting paid either way, if you want to waste your time chatting, they don't mind.",0,1u2NauOy8xDj7aFQET680A,0,1,2014-02-19,review,1

1z4KPFEb4TuYsnmlVu0ZWQ,SymtwwIeg2-u3YBJM7lNmw,"I spoke to a man this morning about the ice covered parking lot and sidewalk, as a business is liable to their customers if someone was to slip and fall due to negligence on the business's part. He told me good luck and that I'm liable to just be careful because everywhere is icy. After two years at this gym I'm fed up with the way they treat their customers. He told me he was fed up with me since I gave him a hard time about being out of towels a few weeks ago (which they've had towels since then). They never clean the parking lot in the winter so make sure you wear boots outside and don't crash your car. Aside from that, this gym is well just that a gym. My biggest critic (aside from rude management and negligence) would have to be that they don't encourage sanitization outside of the cardio room. There aren't towels and spray around the weight machines, which I've never had an issue with, but I'd hate to see that happen. I always make sure to at least wipe off my sweat marks from the machine, cause well that'd be pretty nasty. It is pretty large in terms of size and space to do anything aside from the ordinary weights and cardio. The workers well they're mostly young and don't really care too much (the man who told me I was wrong was older and possibly a manager or owner). They tend to not keep on top of the wash with the towels even when it isn't busy, which can be pretty annoying. Their cardio room always has Fox News on two tvs and then the middle TV has sports center on regardless of what else is on tv. They recently haven't even been putting pens games and stuff on. Must be too busy watching the 52 inch screen they have in the lobby for the workers while the cardio room has max 32 in the middle and 24 on the sides probably. If I had to pay full price for my membership I probably wouldn't belong here, but it's through my insurance. That said I don't swipe my card like most people in the front on my own. The machine is behind the counter. One guy always shows me how to do it myself, which was helpful the first time cause people aren't always around the front desk. That said when he is standing behind there chatting I would expect him to do it since it's his job. This gym is nothing state of the art fancy fancy, but do you really need a fancy looking gym? Their cardio room is pretty massive and even at peak hours I've never had a problem getting a treadmill or elliptical. They actually even have two hellix trainers, which aren't super common yet. Sometimes when things go out of order they take a while to fix them. I've run into the owner or manager one time in the bathroom when someone let a sink over floor and asked if I should tell the guys at the desk and she said oh no they're useless. This gym makes a killing from a) classes b) it's convenient and c) their personal training is a separate company (warrior fitness). I've been meaning to sign up for a trainer and I always see them busy. They all seem awesome and very helpful and challenging. Not sure if they have a separate yelp page, but I would say from what I've seen they'd bust your ass for sure!",0,1u2NauOy8xDj7aFQET680A,0,1,2015-01-29,review,0
uatV7uA6DrTV_iczO9dYrQ,TNlu2CG7O20OkVG0RJcA3g,"As a member for now 8 years I can honestly say, I have never had a negative experience at Amerifit!  The owner and staff could not be more accommodating and strive for member satisfaction.  The owner not only runs the business but personally fixes machines when needed, interacts with the members, and also personally salts and plows the parking lot when needed in the winter himself.  
There is another review on here stating the lot didn't have any attention after which was the largest ice storm we've had in years. I would like to state I was sitting by the counter the day this lady came in upset and unnecessarily yelling at the front desk employee about the lot.  The owner was out there every couple hours doing the best he could to tame the condition of the lot. However on that day I believe everyone's car on the road turned into a snow sled including my own.  If you truly felt in danger being on the roads that day, you probably should of just stayed at home or a work.
I love the fact the owner takes pride in his business and is extremely hands on with the maintenance of the building.  Amerifit has such a welcoming, no intimidation, home-like feel which is what I believe makes this place so special and unique and has kept my loyal membership for the last 8 years.",0,1u2NauOy8xDj7aFQET680A,0,5,2015-10-19,review,0
Nhvkukz5MECqEUQVfh6A6w,nTJ9CWTcxTDKeNtlvy_TYw,"This is review rating may not be for everyone.

Amerifit is a gym where many serious body builders work out.   This is an anti-Planet Fitness (there are no pizza days).   This place is where private personal trainers take on clients who do not have an affiliation with Planet Fitness.  You can pay $5 per day if you want to meet occasionally.

What the casual person may see upon entering:

You will hear lots of grunting and weights being dropped.   Do not be intimidated.   The folks (men and ladies) are doing this for competitions (usually).

The place may seem run down (older weights / machines).   Do not let this deceive you.   

The place may seem small.   Again - do not let this deceive you.  They have smaller rooms / areas.

They do have classes upstairs that seem pretty intense (not my cup of tea).

Why 4 Stars:

1. I followed my trainer (which means I chose my trainer at a location where we could work out).   My previous trainers were great but I did not necessarily like the gym (too crowded or not enough room to work out).

2. Equipment variety.   Example - Cardio Equipment.   Usually when you go into a gym, you will have a treadmill, a stepper, a recumbent bike, bike, elliptical) - All one type.    Amerifit provides a variety of machines such as Cybex.   Cybex is your traditional elliptical but you can control the elevation as well.   They also have machines that will simulate ice skating

3.  Intensity - You do see people seriously working out.   This can either motivate or intimidate you.  It motivates me.   I can also see folks doing exercises correctly.

4.  The folks are nice.   All the associates I have met are very nice.

I apologize to the serious body builders for writing this review, but I think this is a very good secret to share.  Find you a trainer, meet him/her at Amerifit, and workout.   

This is not a chain gym where everything is new with standard (usually leased) equipment.",0,1u2NauOy8xDj7aFQET680A,0,4,2016-03-25,review,2
4d6gHTch3Mytp02o-tzV9Q,QxR3WHUjmWh5xIyqfJkfsw,"I brought my husband and my parents all to Papa J's last time my husband and I were in Pittsburgh. My parents are really picky about their italian food, usually they drive places in east bumf*@ (tarentum, ligonier...) to get their capital I-talian.

My pop is kinda grumbly, and getting him to try something new is like pulling teeth. The only reason I got him here was becuase they were on their way to drop us at the airport.

Well, my dad goes back now regularly and that says a lot, considering he lives in Murrysville. 

The first good sign Dad was happy was that he seemed impressed when it was open- it was noon a few days after Christmas. Second good sign was that Dad ordered wine, at it was only 1 pm. Dad, while not a teetotaler, rarely has a drink before 5 pm so I know he was anticipating a good meal. The kicker was that he was so happy he left our waitress a $20 tip on a $50 meal. 

Can I say, I live in Texas now and I still relive this afternoon back in December? I had chicken picatta...it was perfect. My dad had eggplant rollatini, my mom had a pizza, and my hubby had basic pasta and marinara. It all was amazing, delicous, and inexpensive. In Austin, you can't get a decent italian meal, much less a decent italian meal for under $50 for four people.

 I generally order one of their house salads (think it has a specific name, but can't recall off the top of my head) which has mixed greens and I get it with blue cheese, pine nuts and their yummy vinaigrette. A tad pricey for a salad that's just lettuce and cheese (I want to say about $8 with the extras), but really good. (Especially with some cracked black peeper.) I tend to follow this up with a smaller plate like their red pepper app or the greens & beans. 

The place has sort of a rustic atmosphere and can be on the loud side. It has a comfortable feeling. It also has a solid wine by the glass selection -- better than a lot of places in the 'burgh.

2cvC1yfkqbOKUgoQTxfzfg,eVZ6pr7f03hXSb-Q5cF2Vw,"What a wonderful surprise found in Carnegie PA, just south of Pittsburgh.  I was in town on business with a couple co-workers and after having a not so great meal the night before, we asked one of the locals for a recomendation.  They told us to try this little Italian place called Papa J's and boy did they send us to a great place.

First off, when you walk up to the place, the front and side windows give you a fantastic open view into the kitchen from the outside.  You can stand outside and watch the chef making all the wonderful food and you can smell the fresh bread before you even walk in the door.

I am not sure how long this place has been around but the kitchen looked well used, while the dining area as well as the bar looked very clean and modern, almost as if it had been freshly updated.  

The server was quick to welcome us and suggested several different items off the menu as his favorites when asked.  The three of us were very hungry and wanting to try a few different things, so we began with a Margherita pizza which was absolutely perfect.  They obviously make their own breads and dough for the pizza and I don't think this pizza could have tasted any better.  Then came bowls of Italian wedding soup which was pretty good.  Of everything there, this was the one item I probably could have done without.  Not that it was bad, but there was nothing particularly special about it.  

We also ordered the Garlic Rolls (not that the bread they already give you and the pizza was not enough carbs for 1 meal) and they were to die for.  Crunchy on the outside and warm and chewy inside, these things were a meal by themselves.  One of the guys with me said the pizza sauce would be good on them so he ordered a cup of the pizza sauce (which is fresh made there, not out of some can) and he was right.  As if these little killer bread balls with garlic were not good enough, dipped in the pizza sauce they were even that much better.  

By the time our meals came, we were all pretty full, but we pushed on and continued to eat.  I had the Veal Parmigiano which was tender and very good.  It came with a side of pasta which I tasted just to try and it was excelent as well.  Had I not been eating a weeks worth of carbs in one sitting with all the pre-meal stuff, I certainly would have finished it.  As it was, I ate most but not all of the generous portion of veal.  

One of my co-workers had the Chicken Picatta which he said was one of the best he had ever had and the other guy tried a pasta dish which he said was very good as well.  

They had a great wine selection as well at reasonable prices by the glass or bottle.

Overall a fantastic experience with great food and atmosphere.  I don't really know how expensive the area is for food, but coming from the Chicagoland area, I fouknd this place to be pretty reasonable.  The three of us ate very very well for an average of aproximately $30 each not including alcahol.  Fantastic fresh food at a reasonable price, who could ask for more.

My only complaint is that I had to return to Chicago and I am now craving to return to Papa J's.  I hope work sends me out here again sometime soon!!!",0,P1fJb2WQ1mXoiudj8UE44w,0,5,2011-02-21,review,3

k-a1aAKB0f6w5sHDDEO4IA,G-gqp94DI9ZX3Qp4HdMCmA,"I have to say that I write this review with much regret, because I have always loved PaPa J's. But my recent experience there has changed my mind a bit. 

From the minute we were seated, we were greeted by a server that was clearly inexperienced and didn't know the menu. As I said before, I've been to PaPa J's a good handful of times so I know the menu decently well, but the server couldn't explain any of the questions I had about a couple new dishes I was thinking about trying. I swear this guy must have just looked at the menu for the first time a few minutes ago.

But it wasn't just the knowledge of the menu. It was one thing after another with our server. My wife asked for a glass of water 4 times until she finally got it (at which point the meal was over, so we didn't care at that point).  I mean come on, for a restaurant of this calibre and price is it too much to ask for a glass of water? There was no one filling up water.

My biggest complaint, however, is what happened with our meals. My dad and I both ordered the trout special (trout with roasted red peppers and lump crabmeat). Instead, the meal that was delivered to both of us was trout with a heaping pile of spinach and mushrooms. Not what the special was at all.  And by the way, that item is on the menu as a regular item so whether or not the mistake was made by the server (which, we are sure it was) or the chef, who knows for certain. Not to mention, though, that a good server wouldn't have served us that regardless. 

But before you think we had an unusal experience that was all due to a poor server, let me continue. When we informed our server of the mistake, he didn't really believe us until he checked his order sheet, and then he blamed the error on the chef. At this point, the meal had been sitting (because it took us forever to flag this guy down again) so the trout was basically cold. The server then said he would have the meals re-made. So, he took the meals back to the kitchen. Meanwhile, of course, my wife and mom are eating their meals and my dad and I are sitting there with no meals. Also keep in mind that my wife still had not gotten the water she had been asking for, and my iced tea had been refilled with a soda (yes, believe that or not). All the kitchen did was scrape their ""mistake"" off of our fish! They didn't remake anything. Our fish was served to us again with little pieces of spinach and mushrooms sticking all over it. Quite frankly, the fish wasn't good at all. I honestly would have rather had a fish sandwich from McDonald's that night. The server never did anything to try to make our experience better - he knew we weren't happy, but never offered anything such as dessert on the house. I'm not looking for a handout, but our experience was just plain awful that night. The guy never really even apologized for the mistake. Normally, I may have asked for a manager, but at this point I was ready to just get out of there (plus, we had to be somewhere else that night).

It felt like a neighborhood restaurant. On a Saturday night, the restaurant was full but not crowded.  We were seated in a room with poor acoustics.  It was difficult to hear people at our table and the waitress.  While she tried, I can see the asperation in her face when she had to repeat the specials to both sides of the table.

People ordered bourbon on the rocks before dinner which seemed watered down, while my lemon drop was made nice.  The bread was delicious!  Can you describe it to be creamy?  The fried zucchini was lightly breaded and not too oily.  It was a large portion made up of 2 sliced zucchinis.

We ordered a variety of dishes.  The pasta dish was dry with more pasta than sauce or meat.  Those who ordered the fish special thought it was delicious.  The shrimp dish was enjoyed as well.  I had the chicken marsala which was pretty good.  The marsala sauce wasn't too thick, and the chicken moist.

Papa J's is one of my favorite go to places for dinner when we don't have reservations and want a nice dinner out. My husband and I have eatten here upwards of 20 times over the last few years and have never been disappointed. I assumed that when they opened the alternate bar with lounge area and extra tables for dining on the other side of the resturant that  the overall vibe of the restaurant would change and it would be very busy. I have been proved wrong.  We are always able to walk in on a weekend and get a table within a few minutes. Unfortunately, the alternate bar/lounge area isn't always open.

My favorites are the fried zucchini, wedding soup and pizza.The zucchini is always crispy and seasoned well. The wedding soup has big chunks of carrots and celery. My husband also enjoys the pork entrees especially the grilled pork and the pastas including the tomato cream sauce. Also, their homemade italian bread with oil and vinegar to dip is a great way to wet your appetite. Make sure to add the parmesan cheese that they put on the table.

We LOVED the food, it was delicious. My husband got a chicken parm sandwich, which is served on a yummy flat bread, and I got the chicken basil pizza ( i got an 8 cut and several ppl tried it) we all LOVED it! It was stunning.  It was made with a very delicious crust, nice and crisp, not soggy (like pesto pizza can get)

The one waitress we had JASMINE, was fantastic!  She was bright, friendly and very knowledgeable about the menu.  She took extra time with the older ladies in our group to help them with their selections... 

Now... the other waitress.. Mary something was so incompetent...  She was awful and rude.  She missed 2 people on that side of the table failed to take their order and when we said something she said 'well they didn't speak up!' Ugh.  Then when it was time to sing and cut the cake, my sister in law said 'oh hey can you get the cake so we can sing?'  She came back, cut the cake (all crazy with some huge pieces and some super small pieces like she never in her life cut a sheet cake) and we didn't even sing!  We were mad!!

The place is so pretty, they have a new addition that was just built within the last 2 years (according to my father in law) and its really nice.  They look to have a cool bar area with some modern couches and a really sweet look.   

So good food, great looking place.. one bad waitress. Prices are about middle of the road for an authentic Italian place, nothing crazy.  All in all, we'd like to go back again, but we want Jasmine!",0,P1fJb2WQ1mXoiudj8UE44w,0,4,2013-09-29,review,0

It made no sense, how could we order when the waitress wasn't coming to the table? After arguing with me he ended up taking $6 off of our $200+ bill. Ridiculous. If it were up to me I would have never returned. Unfortunately my family decided to go here again tonight. Again it took a long time to get our food. My food was cold and bland, my kids food was cold. My husbands salmon was burnt to a crisp and my sister in law took one bite of her trout and refused to eat any more because she claims it was so disgusting. The wedding soup and bread were good, but that's it! My drink sat empty throughout my meal and never got refilled even when I asked. Bad food, slow service and rude managers.

KZVgUYGt4eww_GwJ2F0MrQ,RnFLiT_uca0vllufwN7qIg,"We stopped at Papa J's last Friday night (8/1) for a round of drinks. There were 7 of us altogether and we had eaten at another restaurant earlier in the evening.  One member of our party walked up to the bar to let them know we were sitting on the couches along the wall, as it was fairly busy that night. In the short time that he was there, a man who was behind the bar looked at him and then turn away without saying a word or notifying anyone else. He then turned to a waitress who had approached the service area of the bar and asked her if  we could have a server take our drink order. She said ""yep"" and then abruptly turned and walked away. At that point, he asked to see the manager  who came a few minutes later. When my friend told him of what had occurred, the manager said ""What do you want me to do""?

My friend said ""An apology would be a good start"" whereupon the manager looked back at him and said ""Get out and don't come back"" ???????? Are you kidding????

My friend is well traveled and frequently stays at higher end hotels and dines at quality restaurants. He was not screaming or belligerent in any way, shape, or form; simply informing the manager of what had occurred. 

That being said, we left and went back to 131 East, where we had previously eaten. The service there was fabulous, as was the meal and the drinks creative and exquisite.

There are new restaurants that have opened in Carnegie as of late. Papa J's is no longer the only game in town.  Obviously this is the way a simple complaint is handled by management. Appalling!!

My lettuce was drowning in the vinegar. My pesto pasta had no flavor (did not taste like a cream sauce to me) & the pesto was so runny/watery & way too much sauce not enough noodles. My husband's pasta had even less flavor than mine. We ate about a quarter of the food & couldn't even finish it. We took it home & it was so bad I didn't even eat my leftovers.

3JCJYpQpNDC6lmA7JFFIbw,pe4RWvuWu8824WEmCZnuSg,"I struggle to write this review simply because this dining experience confused me. First, the restaurant itself is on a convenient corner st in downtown Carnegie's main street. When you walk in you the first thing you see is a counter filled with desserts and amazing looking house made breads. It rather looks like a deli counter. You have to walk around to get to the hostess station and then can go left to the bar or right to the dining area. A bit confusing layout, but tastefully done. The dining area is brighter than the rest of the restaurant. It felt much more upscale once in the dining area, but I did find the overall restaurant tastefully unique. 

The food - A wide range of Italian dishes and seafood. We ordered the crab hozel as an appetizer. It was an average serving of lump crab meat, I had to ask for cocktail sauce. It was tasty, but cost us $18. We then ordered the veal and shrimp entree with sauteed veggies like artichokes, eggplant, peppers, etc. There were 4 smaller sized cutlets of veal and 3 shrimp. $28. There was no salad or pasta side offered. The dish was prepared properly and was OK. We just felt it needed something else. 

Now the bread that was offered to our table came in a small basket and was filled with a variety of their house made breads. The pepperoni bread was AMAZING! I mean really delish. This alone I would have given 5 stars. 

The service - Our server was...well....I'm not sure what he was quite frankly. Annoying?Confused? Hyper?  He appeared to have no idea what he was doing half the time. Bouncing around the table, asking the same questions over and over, forgetful, spastic, etc. At one point one of my colleagues said, ""Is he on crack?"" We chuckled, but seriously! He forgot to even ask us if we wanted dessert, which was too bad because we saw some amazing looking offerings in the cases as we were leaving.

Overall - If I were in the area again I would definitely stop in to get some pepperoni bread to go, as they do sell it by the loaves. However, I think I would try somewhere else to dine.",0,P1fJb2WQ1mXoiudj8UE44w,1,2,2015-02-07,review,1

2Az24juAhTJtmlqr5UWXSQ,b3c7n7ipeAtMPpHZ3hgJSw,"Did dinner with my GF last Saturday at PaPa J's prior to going to the Off The Wall Theater. This was the first time we've been to this restaurant. We usually stop a Riley's Pour House across the street for a bite before seeing a show in this town but today we decided to shake it up and do something different.

The place is deceptively larger than it looks from the outside. It was also busier than we would have expected on this particular evening and we got one of the remaining tables which was located near the entrance and the bar. The traffic from both the customers and the staff that flowed past us was a little noisy and distracting and we could tell that's why it was one of the last tables available. But our waitress came by promptly, got us drinks (I had a Hoegaarden and my girl ordered an Absolute water and cranberry), gave us menus and recited the specials of the day.

After viewing the menu for a bit, I decided on the Veal Parmigiano; my date went with one of the specials, a chicken and broccoli gnocchi dish. The plates took about 15 minutes to arrive and the portions were humongous... enough for a filling lunch the next day. My veal was tender and delicious but it's really the gnocchi that left the biggest impression. You could tell that it was house made; it was like little fluffy pillows dissolving in your mouth with each bite. I never tasted gnocchi like it before.

Over all I give PaPa J's a big thumbs up. The food was good, most of the dinning area's seemed cozy, the building itself has a certain charm with its high ceiling and the tables draped in white table cloths give it a pristine appearance. Although I thought it was a bit pricy, I didn't feel as if I've been taken.  Other than the location of our table, it was the pre-theater perfect meal.

Tonight a friend and I dined at your location. We were seated in the bar area by the sidewalk, which is what we requested because of the great weather and the happy hour specials. Our server took our order of a gingerale, fried zucchini appetizer, side salad, wedding soup , eggplant rolotini and chicken piccata ( correct spelling).

We thoroughly enjoyed the bread & wedding soup.
The side salad was rather bland and unexciting, lacking flavor & texture. The Spring salad consisted of leaf lettuce, a single slice of tomato and one black olive. I would have expected some additions such as onions, peppers, cheese, cucumbers, croutons, carrots and the like.
 
  We enjoyed the fresh air while waiting for our appetizer, but were growing concerned that it would arrive too close to the meal, so we asked the server ( bartender ) about the appetizer and he told us that he had forgot to ""put it in"". He offered to put it in at this point, but advised us that our meals would be out soon. We decided to just wait for our meals and forgo the appetizer which were looking forward to. 
 
  The main dishes were acceptable, not outstanding. The eggplant was very tasty and well prepared.  The Chicken Piccata was flavorful, but not as expected.
The chicken seemed to have been steamed or baked. It had no signs of being coated and sautéed  to a rich golden brown. The chicken was just pale white.
The sauce was a simple lemon flavor, it lacked any depth that would have resulted from the browning of the chicken. I tasted no garlic or shallots. The sauce lacked that famous tang usually supplied by capers, which were absent.  No pasta was served with the chicken. The side of vegetables were well cooked, buy again lacked any real flavor. The would have benefited from a roasting which would have produced a rich savory taste produced by extraction of the natural sugars.

  Once our meals were finished  our plates were taken and we waited another 20 minutes for the check. The server seemed more concerned with what was on television rather than his customers. The total was $43 and change.
I would have expected the salad and soup would have been removed from the bill for the error of not putting in our appetizer order, but no such offer was made and 
I saw no manager come around and check on the customers, as is customary.
I am hesitant to go back to this restaurant or  recommend it to anyone after tonights dining experience.  I hope this feedback will be beneficial to your business.",0,P1fJb2WQ1mXoiudj8UE44w,1,2,2015-05-11,review,6

Another couple in our party had made reservations before hand and when we arrived a couple of minutes after that time, we were immediately taken to our table.  Whenever you first walk into Papa Js you immediately head past both their dessert case and bread making area.  That is pure genius on their part as both their desserts and bread look good!  Then to get to our table we also walked past a bar and up a flight of stairs.  After that I didn't really see much else of the restaurant.

After our whole party had arrived and our waitress had taken all of our drink orders she came back up to our table and promised us that she would be back shortly as she had some desserts to take to a table.  After about 15 minutes or so she finally did make it back to our table.  For my dinner entree I decided on having the Romano chicken.  It came out a short time later with a side of broccoli.  The chicken had a nice golden color to its breading and tasted pretty good although a bit salty.  I can take at least some credit for that though as I may have used the Parmesan that was on the table quite liberally.  Meanwhile the broccoli was over cooked for my tastes and seemed mushy whenever I bit into it.

The bottom line for me is that I might stop by here again in the future.  I wouldn't be the person to recommend it but I also wouldn't turn it down.

Thus, allowing proper staffing. We arrived early and headed to the bar. The bartender there greeted us quickly and took great care of us. When it was time for our reservation we were seated immediately. That is where the efficiency and service took a turn for the worst. We sat for 20 minutes before a server came to our table. At that point, she said I'll grab you water and bread.  Another 10 minutes go by and members of our party went to the bar to grab drinks as the server vanished (still no water or bread). She finally comes back to the table with bread (no waters) and takes our drink orders (about 40 mins into sitting at the table). Next thing we know, a nice gentleman by the name of Patrick is our NEW server. He really stepped up the service and should be commended. However, we ordered the veal stuffed banana peppers which arrived cold. We also ordered the ""incredible white pizza"" which was incredibly cold. While Patrick stepped up the service the entire experience was fairly terrible.
Not once did the front of house manager come check on us.

The food was subpar but it was a lost cause by the time we got it. For $50 a person it was terrible. The menu was a small, select menu. I got the shrimp and veal and my veal was dry. But as for the real issue....

Last night for NYE we went for dinner with the intention of going out to celebrate after. we had reservations for 7pm made weeks in advance. We didn't get our food until around 930 and didn't get our check for another hour. We were there for an hour and a half before we even got bread. Everything we asked for was ""I'll get it to you in a little bit."" I ordered a drink 3 times and never got it. I don't understand because it was not busy at all and they only had a select menu. You'd think they'd have a handle on things. How don't you have salads ready and made in a cooler or bread baskets prepared when reservations were made weeks ago?

ryiL6-gZ5XFsogqLlqwxvA,hiidqKli7cCFo1GOGB9ZIg,"THE WORST DENTAL EXPERIENCE OF MY LIFE.  THEY ARE BUTCHERS!  My husband and I went to Emmert Dental in Bethel Park for a routine cleaning and check up.  I had one tooth that I had a recent root canal on and a few small cavities that needed filled.  After the so called dentist - Dr Carnavali - did my exam, I needed 3 additional root canals and an extraction! An extraction on the tooth that just had a root canal. I was told that part of the tooth had broken off and that a crown was no longer possible.  I didn't know any better, so I agreed to schedule the extraction for a few weeks later. The ""dentist"" wanted to extract it that day, but I had plans for the weekend and was not about to be in pain. So, 2 weeks later, I went in for the extraction.  After they gave me novocaine they get me with ""you need a bone graft also in that area since we are extracting that tooth"". I have never had any issues with bone loss with previous extractions so I didn't feel it was necessary. I had 3 employees surrounding me, pressuring me for this bone graft. So, I reluctantly agreed. I had to pay $259.00 for this ""bone graft"". So, I signed everything. I wasn't even given enough time to read the document, so I should have known and got up and left right then and there. The ""dentist"" started the extraction. I have never been so uncomfortable in my life. He pulled on my tooth, used a metal instrument to pound on my tooth and was pulling so hard that my head was coming up and slamming back down against the head rest.  Finally, after a good 15 minutes of this torture, he ripped the tooth out of the side of my jaw. I was literally ganging from all the blood running down the back of my throat. He then stuck some pink powder up in the extraction area. I'm assuming this was the bone graft.  I ended up with many stitches. I was given an antibiotic and instructed to schedule an appointment for the following Saturday so they could start the bridge. Then I was hit with a bill of $569.00! My insurance covers 100% of extractions.  I was in so much pain for 2 weeks following the extraction. Pain severe enough that I had to call off work and I couldn't sleep at night.  I refused to go back to Emmert Dental.  And after a visit to a very reputable dentist, an endodontist and an oral surgeon, I have to have oral surgery to try and repair the damage Emmert Dental has done to my mouth.  They caused a very large deformity in my jaw and I am at risk to lose additional teeth.  Save yourself a lot of time, money and pain.  Emmert dental only cares about the money, will over charge you and leave you less than happy with the dental work.  They are butchers and should not even call themselves dentist. And if you have an issue with their billing practices, don't expect to that resolved easily.  I have called numerous times and I am always told that the manager and or billing department is not in.  I have contacted the BBB and a lawyer.  I expect and want a full refund.  No one should have to go thru what I am currently going thru.  They do unnecessary extractions so they can do a more expensive procedure such as a bridge or an implant.  Now I have to go thru oral surgery, more pain and suffering and more time missed from work because of Emmert Dental.  And the root canals they said I needed, my current dentist and my endodontist both agreed that I do not need tooth canals.  In fact, the teeth are perfectly healthy.  They are crooks and butchers.",0,xxWFOD46ubTSF3nPRM19BA,0,1,2014-06-22,review,3

The noise level was also at a nice working level - not too loud, music just barely audible.

I do wish there was more seating.  It is nice that this location has a counter at the end of the bar for sole workers, but it doesn't replace more tables.  I'm sure this isn't as much of a problem in the summer when there's the space outside.

There was a treat receipt promo going on, but the barista didn't tell me about it, which I found odd.  Usually when they have promos like that going on, they ask everyone if they want their receipt to come back later in the day to claim whatever the offer is.  Today it was one of their new pastries for $1, I know in the summer they do $2 grande iced drinks with that morning's receipt.

The store has typically had the supplies that I need from cake and cupcake baking and icing to scrap booking supplies. This location is pretty average compared to other Michaels - it's exactly what you would expect when going to this store. It's not a large store, but it's not a small store -- just average.

I do enjoy using the Michael's coupons when shopping. I definitely save a lot of money! Instead of toting around the paper versions, I actually have the iPhone app that has coupons available to use from the app. 

My only complaint is that sometimes it takes a while to check out at this location. I don't normally have a problem - usually only one or two people ahead of me - but sometimes it can be much slower. Today, for example, there were only two customers ahead of me, but one of them was having issues with a coupon. The line began to get longer and longer, and though a couple associates were lingering up front, they kept calling for someone else. From personal experience of being a manger in a retail store, do not linger or let your associates linger near the cashiers without jumping on register.

They've got lots of cool items all over the store that you're convinced that somehow you need. (Because it is soooo cute, and you could TOTALLY do something with it. Right..?) The store feels cluttered because there is so much stuff everywhere. However, if you're looking for something specific, good luck.

The bf and I got lost around Pittsburgh for 40 min. trying to find this location and on top of the unnecessary 1 hour wait for our food, the food itself was just so crappily made. It was so bad and we had waited a ridiculous amount of time (c'mon, Steak N Shake is basically a glorified McD's), our waiter comped our WHOLE MEAL.

If not for the compensation, I would have been pissed that we had to pay for such a crappy meal. The bf, on the other hand, was more upset about the principle of the matter... we had trekked all that way just to get our Steak N Shake fix (since both of us haven't had it since our undergraduate days) and it was a major fail.

I visited Steak and Shake on New Year's Eve in preparation for an evening of mostly tame partying. I was unnaturally attracted to their Wisconsin Buttery Burger, which is a double patty cheeseburger topped with grilled onions between two buns that have been buttered. Sounds good right?

Well, I get this delicious diet abomination and discover that my buns had been dunked in butter. The pearly gates of cholesterol laden heaven with the triglyceride angels were singing to me.  I took the liberty of increasing my sodium intake by pouring their burger/fries seasoning on the buns and I literally got tears in my eyes....most likely from the salt overload, but possibly because this was one of the most evilly decadent things I had eaten in a long time.

This is not meant to be a fine dining experience. Service wasn't fast but it wasn't slow. It just kind of was. However, the waitress did get a point for explaining that the order would take X amount of time to all patrons. So I give them a pass for being upfront about it.

I was there at around 9pm, with about 9 folks from my family (visiting relatives included). 
There were several things that got me annoyed, one after another. 
I was ok that it took a while for us to be seated. But after we ordered, what really got me angry was that the food took a VERY long time to arrive. We had 2 kids with us and we ordered 2 kids meals, and had asked for those to be brought sooner. After about 25-30 minutes of nothing, I went to the servers (who were just NOT paying attention to us anyway - the main server's name for our table was Angel) and asked where our meals were. One checked with another, who then informed me that they were working on it. 
What made me even angrier is that they tried to downplay everything, telling me that it had only been 5 minutes. Then one of the servers (manager?) tells me that ""ok, may be it's been 10 minutes, but it's coming"". Then I hear some of the servers talking about our orders. The same gentleman then came to our table, sat down next to me and told me that it's only been 10 minutes and that they were working on our order, and tried to give me some explanation about why that's not really a long time at all. It was clearly almost half an hour or longer by that time. 
The food finally arrived about 10 minutes after that. But the food came cold. 
We were so HUNGRY by that point, we just ate whatever we could. Neither Angel nor anyone else came to top up our drinks even ONCE. I had to ask for mine, but by that point I was in no mood to take a sip even. 
I paid ($58.20) and I again got the same gentleman who tried (again!) to explain to me that it was just 10 minutes, and that ""given everything, we were within normal limits"". Wow. 
After about an hour and half at the restaurant, we all just shook our heads and left. 

I have written to them on their website, and will see if they follow up.

A throwback to old timey diners, steak and shake is where you get a decent meal at a good price. 

My sisters and I arrived on a Tuesday afternoon around 3pm catching their 2-4 happy hour, which we read on the door upon entry; a lovely surprise. This meant that all shakes and drinks were 50% off! 

I ordered the western BBQ burger, which was 2 thin patties, cheese, bacon, BBQ sauce, and fried onions. It came with shoe string fries (my favorite), all for the low price of $4.79. Are you kidding me? What's not to like! The food was actually pretty good! I liked it a lot. Since it was happy hour I also ""splurged"" on a chocolate covered strawberry shake. It was meh. Could have gone without it. The overpowering taste of artificial strawberry really turned me off, but the hot fudge saved it. But, how can you really go wrong with hot fudge?

All in all, 3 meals and 3 shakes came to $20. A steal. Also the food is good! I enjoyed it. I'd come back.",1,6ilJq_05xRgek_8qUp36-g,0,3,2012-08-09,review,0

I sat for almost ten minutes at the window while my food was prepared.  During that time I wished I could have taken back my order and also wished that I hadn't paid already.  

While sitting at the window I decided to just stare inside and watch some of the employees doing their job.  What disturbed me the most was watching the employee making the milkshakes.  Making a milkshake isn't that hard or glamorous of a thing to watch.  What disgusted me was that the guy actually lifted several of the containers for the milkshakes and smelt them.  I mean smelt them to see if they were clean, instead of actually taking the extra minute or two to clean the container.  After witnessing this my food was finally ready and I drove away.

When I finally got to eating my food I was underwhelmed.  The fries had no flavor and with the size of the cut it appears you get more than what you ordered.  The ""steakburger"" really, they should just call it a burger, was overpowered by the BBQ sauce on it.  It was all I could taste.

We were a party of 6 adults and 1 kid. Raquan was our server and he was so nice. He took our order but sadly we waited 45 minutes for it to com.Everyone around us who just ordered 15 minutes before already had their food. I've worked at steak n shake before. it less than 10 minutes to cook both the burgers and fries. I have no idea if kitchen lost our ticket or what but i did see our server talking to them more than once about our order so atleast he was on top of it.

The manager here needs better training. He stood at the register the entire time cashing people out even though clearly the kitchen was behind and customers in the dining area were angry (saw a couple leave after waiting for server and another table talk to manager about wait time). Again i've worked at another steak n shake. The counter girl is responsible for cashing people out and take out orders.. manager should helping on the grill or over-seeing everything going on. Poor Raquan had to keep coming over to apologize whenever the manager should have. Who tf trained the boss here?

Sadly after an hour at the restaurant and 45 minutes waiting on food, we told our server we had to leave. He told us dont worry about the drinks. We tipped him and went to eat at chikfila. At least the rest of the night was fun at D&B.

j7DlVihvISsgrKFsreR-Qg,7GEU8IZfnqZwTd9zXMPvIg,"Well, the experience did not start well. When we walked in the singing we heard was NOT good. Oy was it not good... Thankfully, it (mostly) improved from there.

So there were 3 piano players rotating out on a half hour basis. So each was on for an hour and off for half. Of the 3, two were really good. Good singers, good piano players, and very funny. The third guy, well, not so much. Piano skills were fine. But his singing was not. When he sang in his range, he wasn't too bad actually, but too often he reached for notes that he couldn't get to or forced things that just weren't going to happen. Often his jokes fell completely flat. Luckily the other two usually did most the talking.

They played a variety of songs as requested by the crowd and would do them in unconventional styles if requested (Closer by NIN as sung by a lounge singer was a highlight). We requested Britney Spears' Toxic cause we thought it would be funny and so they gave it a shot and as luck would have it, it turned out REALLY good. That takes some serious talent to pull off. If they didn't know it (like Toxic) they'd find it and play it. They played a wide variety of stuff.

Part of the experience is based on the crowd. We had a couple larger groups (there on a Thursday night, so smallish group in general) that they interacted with a lot, providing some running jokes and comedy. Of course, that also meant some annoying drunk people feeling like they could take over half the show.

My friends were BIG fans of the super cheap beer specials. $1 drafts from Rock Bottom next door. The waitress wasn't great but it could have been that she was the only one there and the layout isn't that easy to navigate. The bar was generally uncrowded though so getting service there was fast.

If in the Waterfront for a night out, definitely a place to hit and have some fun if you are up for some fun and willing to sit through a couple clunkers of songs/jokes. Having a fun loving group of friends to mock things with when they go off the rails a bit will help make it more fun.",0,MKyk4F4HSzHF8v-4cYe3Ww,0,4,2010-12-08,review,0
MJnIMhzm4onnjtzyprVXJA,emGY8AzjqZ3Tmp4tGyL2Kg,"While we were in Pittsburgh for the Winter Classic on New Years Day, we figured we'd see what the area had to offer for NYE. My wife and I, along with my friend and his girlfriend hit up Sing Sing in Homestead. It's apparently located on what was the site of one of the largest steel mills in the area. When it closed they turned the entire site into a large outdoor shopping and entertainment development. The only remaining artifacts from what once was, were the nine or so original mill smoke stacks still standing at the primary entrance. Pretty cool.

Sing Sing, which is a piano bar, is attached to the Rock Bottom Brewery and serves a selection of RBB's in-house brews and shares a similar menu. There are no TV's, no sports memorabilia (which is rare for this city), and no big booths for large groups. This place is all about being a cabaret with the focus on the musicians. Mind you this isn't a bad thing, just note that if you want a bar, go next door or across the street to Dave and Busters. I'd say Sing Sing holds about 150 people seated.

This particular night they were hosting a (shocker) NYE's party. For $40 bucks a person you got a choice of two entrees (beef tenderloin tips or lemon chicken), veggies, mashed potatoes, one free drink coupon, a midnight champagne toast, and, what turned out to be over four hours of non-stop music. Again... Pretty Cool.

There were three musicians holding down the fort playing more than just piano (drums, electric synth, bass guitar, and apparently I missed the sax). There was plenty of crowd involvement. As in most piano bars you request songs along with a tip. The larger the tip, the better chance of hearing your song you have. I put three requests on a sheet with a 10 and managed to get two played. Their rendition of Toto's Africa was fantastic and surprisingly, my curve ball got hit out of the park when one of the guys actually knew the tune and words to the Theme from TV's ""Growing Pains."" I was sold from that point on.

I will take this time to note that this is NOT a family friendly joint. I'm not sure if it was 21+ only but I certainly wouldn't bring anyone too young to drive. A good amount of sexual refrences and strong language awaits you.

Drinks were stiff and not horribly overpriced. I think rail mixed drinks were $7.00 and beers were 6 or so (RBB doesn't brew anything I particularly enjoy so I stuck with rum and cokes). All and all my bill wasn't scary and I'm not used to that on Dec 31st. Waitress staff was really nice and incredibly attentive. No complaints there. 

The only down side to everything was group seating as you're sitting at 2-top cab tables. It was easily fixed though as the group next to us was up for rearranging tables from side to side to front to back (allowing us to talk and share food/booze etc), also, being a tourist, we had no idea how hard it would be to get a cab in Homestead. Understandably NYE has its issues with cab availability but we had to wait 2.5 hours for a cab because, as we found out, Homestead is a very suburban community right outside of the city and everyone drives. 

Ooops!

All and all a good time and someplace I'd certainly return to if for any reason I'd be back in Pittsburgh... as long as I have a car.",0,MKyk4F4HSzHF8v-4cYe3Ww,0,4,2011-01-17,review,1

I wasn't really into it when I first got there but as the night went on and lager went in I started to warm up to the place.

I WISH I could play a song at the drop of a hat. Too bad I never took piano lessons and I'd probably end up mumbling half the lyrics other than the chorus. Unless it's Salt n' Pepa's Shoop. 

This is a really great place to go when you have out of town guests or are looking for a fun place to take someone for a birthday celebration or a fun night out. It's just something different to do other than boozing it up at the bars on a Saturday night. 

Keep in mind you'll be paying around a $5-10 cover plus whatever drinks and food you get. The good thing is the food is coming from the attached Rock Bottom Brewery. So a lot of it is restaurant quality good. Plus the brewery beer is actually pretty good! OF course you will be paying restaurant price drinks...so of course they're up charged a bit. But you do pay for the whole experience....so you gotta get into the spirit with some spirits! 

The guys who play are incredibly talented. There's 2 guys that will take requests and play songs on the piano. They pretty much play ANYTHING you ask. Contemporary songs, throw back songs, fight songs, rap songs, pop songs. You name it, they play it. 

My favorite part is when they switch out to another two guys. They'll all four get on stage and play two piano's, a guitar and drums. They usually rock out with some fun familiar songs (um, Journey, of course!). 

The birthday song is seriously the best. They sing to you....and call you some names....with expletives. But in a totally nice way of course. You just have to go!",2,MKyk4F4HSzHF8v-4cYe3Ww,2,4,2011-03-21,review,2
bvu13GyOUwhEjPum2xjiqQ,Y8CsvVEZH3PyxTCuKXTvzA,"Dueling piano bars in Pittsburgh started at Station Square, and they died out. Then when the chain restaurant magnet ""waterfront"" opened in 2000 the parent company of The Rock Bottom Breweries decided to open Sing Sing in back of The Brewery.

When it first opened it was pretty cool. The very first house band could put on a show that led to standing ovations. I know, I was there. From Stairway to Heaven to Free Bird, Stayin' Alive to She's My Cherry Pie, Elton John to the Boss, they were amazing at sounding like the bands they were covering. Equally incredible were the obscure songs that audience members would shout out, songs only you though you knew, and they would effortlessly sing a good portion of the song, sounding like the band who's song they sung.

But today, Sing Sing seems like it's stuck in the early part of the 21st century. The whole dueling piano, shout out a song to stump the band, Sing us a song you're the piano man has run it's course.

The premise seemed kind of fun, but when I got there it did not take long for Sing Sing to disappoint. The $7 cover was way too high for this place, and the drinks were not good. The music the guys played was all stuff from like 1987. Nothing modern, mostly stuff you would hear on Bob FM during the two o'clock hour at work. The medley from Grease was a crowd pleaser I guess.

Part of their schtick is that if a member of your party is having a birthday or wedding or what have you then you can pay to have that person dragged on stage and they will sing a song to them. They were doing dirty versions of well known songs, and there was really only one joke.  ""Hey there Delilah"" became ""Hey There V****a"" and that was the cleverest one. Hope you like 7th grade dirty jokes, because you'll be hearing a lot of them. Mostly ones that you already know from 7th grade.

When we started going there you couldn't get a seat unless you got there early.  It was always packed.  However, each year the crowd seems to get smaller and smaller.  Crowd is an important component of a piano bar due to the interactive nature of it all.  I was there last Saturday night (8/4/12) and there was about 20-30 people there.  Very slow and boring.  It appears the crowd is no longer allowed up on stage, taking a lot of the interactive fun out of what this place used to be.  This was likely my last time at Sing Sing.  Save your $7 and skip this place.  A real shame because this place was once a lot of fun.",0,MKyk4F4HSzHF8v-4cYe3Ww,0,2,2013-06-10,review,1

w16jpVr-b-0gd6YHwnIarg,Z3pPo5xNko8KeieelkSadQ,"Picture Billy Joel's ""Piano Man"" DOUBLED mixed with beer, a rowdy crowd, and comedy - Welcome to Sing Sing!  A unique musical experience found in Homestead.

If you're looking to grab a bite to eat or a beer, come on in!  Serving food and brews from Rock Bottom Brewery, Sing Sing keeps your tummy full while you listen to two (or more) amazingly talented pianists take your musical requests.  They'll play anything you'd like, for tips of course.  Wanting to hear Britney Spears?  Toto?  Duran Duran?  Yep, they play that... new or old.

The crowd makes the show, so make sure you come ready for a good time.  If the crowd is dead, it's harder for the Guys to get a reaction.  If you're wanting to have some fun, it can be a GREAT time!  It's the perfect place for Birthday parties - especially if you want to embarrass a friend.  The guys will bring them up to the pianos and perform a little ditty.  For being a good sport, you get the coveted Sing Sing bumper sticker.  Now who wouldn't want that?

The beer left something to b desired as they r a micro brewery so u can only get their crafts. I asked for something similar to yeungling but what I got was nothing like it.

I had no complaints about the place itself! The guys were hilarious and watching my brother get made fun of multiple times was just the cherry on top! Anddd this has to be the only place I've ever enjoyed being around people who were sloppy drunk, because the comedians take no prisoners!

_f-Vd7RXlwd03jEzzLetOg,Gk8PYxCfvlp2VKnhGCAhpQ,"My friend is a piano teacher, so I took it as a good sign that Sing Sing would be quality stuff. It was her birthday, and I didn't really know anything about dueling piano bars. I was picturing glossy black grand pianos with glittering notes, pianists in black jackets and crystal glasses full of red wine. I am really, really glad I was wrong. 

It was gritty, bawdy and quintessentially Pittsburgh. First off, the pianos are scuffed to hell, considering the number of tipsy people who sit on them nightly while being mildly humiliated. The musicians hammer away at them, and they're covered with N@ and Sing Sing stickers. It's obvious they've been well-loved. The music is anything but the elevator music I was picturing; it's rock, hip-hop, oldies, pop, and just about any genre imaginable thanks to the request system (send up a piece of paper with some money) and the amazing repertoire of the musicians. For instance, ""Rubber Ducky"" and ""Gangsta's Paradise"" were both featured when I was there, and both performed impeccably. They also honored a request for a Taylor Swift song only to receive $30 and a request for ""anything else,"" which they promptly followed. The musicians also do funny versions of popular songs, and throw in things like ""yinz"" instead of ""you.""

I saw in awe of the performers for a decent portion of the night. It must take a particularly special type of person to put on a show like this, considering the energy, confidence, wit, empathy, boldness, silliness, cleverness, and sheer talent a job like this requires. They rotate performers in and out so there's not even an intermission. I've read comments about the baseness of the humor, but I had no doubt the guys up on stage were intelligent dudes. They had great personalities: one was about 140 pounds, cheeky, and quick-witted. He acted out every sport in the winter olympics, and was pretty into this 90-something-year-old lady in the audience called Joan. The other had crazy hair and bright blue Chucks, beatboxed as well as he sang, and made it point to play a handful of songs for my friend's birthday. ""I think Ray Charles is the most soulful guy of all time,"" he said when she requested him.

There were tons of people celebrating birthdays, and one big bachelorette party the Saturday night I was there. The performers bring the birthday boy/girl, bachelor/bachelorette, etc. on stage (for a $20 tip, which is pretty easy to scrounge up among friends) and humiliate the hell out of them, i.e. this is not the place to be if you can't laugh at yourself. My friend had a short dress on when she sat on the piano, and they sang a three-minute song about her vagina.

Luckily, the show eclipsed the bad service and overpriced, weak drinks, because those did feature heavily throughout the night. The rest of the staff was friendly, however, and I stumbled on the door guy singing and dancing by himself, which made me smile.

Sing Sing is definitely not an every weekend type of thing (much like Hofbräuhaus), but is a splendid way to celebrate a special occasion. Definitely belongs on every required Pittsburgh experiences list.",1,MKyk4F4HSzHF8v-4cYe3Ww,0,4,2014-02-02,review,1

Shut out to the piano players, who can not only play the piano, but also sing, play the drums and the sax. They are funny and know how to keep a crowd entertained. Also know some pretty obscure songs. 

My big criticism is the set up. If you don't have a reservation and/or come later in the evening, it's difficult to get seats. Believe me, I don't mind standing, but it does become a bit awkward when you have to keep scooting over to let waitresses and patrons past you.

We all had so much fun that we went back for my buddy's bachelor party.

There were some drawbacks though. We went on a Thursday night so the atmosphere was lacking as the place was pretty empty. And of course they are a little pushy soliciting tips when the place is empty. But it's not our fault the place is empty on Thirsty Thursday, if their drinks weren't so damn expensive maybe more people would show up. And sometimes they used vulgar language which was just unnecessary since they would have otherwise still been hilarious. Also there was no table service, and the only bartender was a bitch.

My suggestion is that you call ahead and reserve a table for however large your party is. Don't forget it's $7 to get in unless it's your birthday it's free for you! If you eat at rock bottom it's $3.50 for you to get in! 

This is a dueling piano bar and its definitely a great time! The musicians are very talented and can play the drums,piano,and harmonica. Well that's what it was this night!

The service of was fantastic l! Our server had to deal with 22 of us and didn't miss a beat at all!

One thing I really like is that they always pick up the phone. You wouldn't believe how annoying it is when businesses don't do this during normal business hours. They're so personable and gave me an honest quote that I couldn't turn down because it was the lowest in town (I checked out 5 places). They just really made this process painless and smooth. I believe it's a family-run business, and boy does it show in their hospitality.

Fran and Jason were the ones that I worked with -- extremely knowledgeable and patient, especially with a customer like me who wants to make sure all the paperwork is thorough and calculations are accurate. Joe DiIorio's (with an ""i"" not an ""l"") Auto Body also works closely with Enterprise Car Rental down the street, so they came and picked me up. Those guys down there have a great relationship with this body shop as well and were really accommodating.

Overall, the quality of their work is amazing. I had a large dent on the driver side front bumper and had to replace my light (they ended up getting an OEM light instead of the aftermarket one because it didn't match) and get a brand new bumper.

When I arrived to pick up my vehicle, I was pleasantly surprised to see that they had vacuumed, washed, and waxed my car! Most importantly, the repair work was absolutely top notch.

He answered one question and said he would have another millwork person call me. Millwork never called me! By July 3, I called our salesman (David Crane). He was surprised that I had not heard from the installer. He told me he would send a message to the installation dept about calling us.Today it's July 8th and we STILL have not heard a peep from anyone at Lowes. Our total order that we planned on spending at Lowe's was around $1700.00 !! I called today and asked to talk to a store Manager. I told him that we have not heard from anyone at Lowe's and that we are not going to proceed with our order. I told him we would like our $35.00 back. He said OK, just bring in your receipt the next time you are at the store. He never apologized, he never even asked me what my customer number was so he could look up our order and maybe somehow save this sale !!!! I cannot believe how unprofessional this store was ! Goodbye Lowes...Hello Home Depot !! What a shame ! David Crane our salesperson was very nice and helpful to us...too bad he is losing the sale.",0,gClSqcwuLsgyZRCzhJc7Dg,0,1,2014-07-08,review,0

My most recent experience with customer service was AMAZING. So a hose burst on my hot tub. Call repair guy or try to fix it myself? I gave it a go. Took pictures of the hose and fitting and headed to the plumbing section. I showed the gentleman the picture and asked for help. He didn't have exactly the fitting for a hot tub, but gave me what he thought would work. It did! Under $3 bucks later and all was a go! Winter came and it sprung a leak in same spot. My fault and maybe lack of strength to tighten fitting and frigid temps. Back to plumbing section. Same gentleman. Gave me the advice again and bam, fixed!

They have an excellent new tap system. Last time I went, they had Thirsty Dog Leghumpper on draft, and it was perfect. The system really elevates already awesome beer. Plus, the selection is awesome. 

It is a sports-themed bar, so you can expect drunk locals, loud TV's and plenty of yelling. I'm sort of into that, so it doesn't bother me, although I do think their staff is not well equipped enough to work among the chaos. Service is often slow, and they give the waitresses ZERO training in the beers that they offer. This is not a good place for trying something new, as they can't tell you a thing about it. 

The biggest downfall of Duke's, though, is the food. I've had three different, but equally simple, dishes there; A Burger, a Cheesesteak and Chicken Tenders. The first was flavorless and cold. The second was passable, but nothing special. And the last were absolutely awful. Honestly, the batter and size of the chicken made me so ill, I had to call it an early night. I ate two of the 7 tenders (SEVEN!) and had to quit. 
Their fries are very good. And so are the wings.

The prime rib came with no horseradish sauce or au jus. I asked for a horseradish sauce, which they had, but the container was so small I had to ask for another. It was a similar situation with the large side salad. It was pretty big, and required at least a second side of dressing.

The drinks were very fairly priced and feature a full bar and some great craft beer options. The food was just OK.  I ordered the wings, which were very good in a unique way.  The sauce is a mix of ranch and buffalo sauce and the wings come submerged in it. Initially this threw me for a loop but after trying them I can see why people love them, messy but delicious.

Hate to do it but I need to leave a review in hopes the manager can get things right. One of the main issues is that the kitchen is overcooking the hell out of the food I've ordered the past 2 visits. 

I can deal with a long wait which is understandable when there is a game on but having to wait for something that comes out missing something and overcooked can be frustrating especially given the cost. 

Last visit was a burger. I gave up and refused the offer for another. Bartenders were super cool about it and even offered me free drink tokens which I decided to redeem today. 

I felt bad just ordering free beer so I ordered a sandwich. It was the roast beef and turkey club which was described specifically on the menu as medium rare which sounded pretty good to me. The roast beef was beyond that. I would say extra well done. Obviously one of the chefs is struggling but I'm not totally sure that the beef was cooked in house. I'm not a chef but know when to pull a roast beef out of the cooker to achieve the proper temp. Anyway I decided not to say anything since the sandwich was still pretty edible and because of my girlfriend being embarrassed of me complaining. 

Decent beer selection. Waitress was very pleasant and attentive. Bar staff not so much this visit. We were ignored until I grabbed a table in the back. Neither of us weren't very happy about this. Possibly a no standing policy since there was only one empty chair at the bar?

The Homestead (Pittsburgh) location of Dave & Busters is just one of the almost 50 locations across the country - from New York to Florida to California - - from Canada to Mexico.  

The Dave & Busters idea was conceived in Little Rock, Arkansas back in the 1970s. Two different businesses (one a popular watering hole & one a game & entertainment business) were right next door to each other. The two young owners were friends and quickly realized that combining their businesses made perfect sense. So they opened the first combined D & B in  . . . . no, not Little Rock, but Dallas! To this day there are no D & B's in Little Rock. Not sure what is up with that! But lots of other cities have been the beneficiaries of these two friends combining their businesses.

The one in Pittsburgh is the only one I have ever been to.  When I lived there, a group of friends and co-workers (and me, of course!)used to go there for Happy Hour & Power Hour . . . . at least once a week. We had a blast!  A great place to kick-back and let the worries of the work day melt away.

Wonder if they'll ever open one in Marin County, CA? Shucks!  Probably not. Not a Marin County scene, for sure. 

WHAT A BLAST IT WAS THOUGH! I miss going to D & B. They have all the classics, like billiards & shuffleboard, plus over 200 interactive & video games. A rechargable Power Card provides an easy way to access all the games.  

POWER HOUR is game HAPPY HOUR - - an entire hour of classic and video games for just  ten bucks.  

A GREAT BAR, WONDERFUL FOOD AND SERVICE! A RELAXING AND FUN WAY to spend a Friday or Saturday evening. You'll never want to leave. Meet your friends here, grab a beer and a burger or steak and hit the games. 

Time will just evaporate . . . . while you laugh and drink with your favorite girl, your best friend or even your boss!  

DAVE & BUSTERS! LOTS OF PARKING! LOTS OF FUN!

You pay for games using credits from mag-stripe cards. This lets D&B give their games arbitrary prices and makes it harder for you to really know how much you are spending. Menus for drinks and food have no prices. $6.05 for a Banana Split cocktail? $3.40 for a Michelob?  I have no idea whether that is expensive but not showing the prices is clever because they can price their things and not have to obey pricing psychology (like anchors and so forth).

Waitstaff hassle you repeatedly to order desserts. Oh, and the dining room has plastic demos dessert trays to get that thought going in your mind as you walk to your table.

The games are all violent shooters or racing games don't appear to have changed much since 2002 when I last went to D&B in California. Hope they can find more innovative arcade games in the future.

Un-nerving actually. 

Because Dave and Buster's is all about excess. Almost obscenely so.

As far as food - their stuff is standard. Most of it is fried and as another reviewer pointed out - not very healthy. At all actually. You have to really scour the menu to find some somewhat decent viable and nutritious options.

But most people don't come to Dave & Buster's for food. They come for the games.

And while I've never been that into video games or arcade games - my brother and sister always have.  I was apprehensive about having a good time here  - but after awhile - my siblings' enthusiasm about the place became contagious and I found myself really enjoying myself.

When I started thinking about how we would have a manageable lunch - The only idea I could come up with was the Golden Corral - I knew that was not going to work for me.

We decided to do something local and walking distance - D&B was it.

It is what you expect - quiet for lunch video games and a bar nearby but I had to forgo any festivities - it was a work lunch.   I was pleased they had a under 600 calorie menu.   I am trying to maintain a normal diet due to my stretchy pants being out of style and not wanting to look like a character out of Family Guy.

The waitress was very friendly and organized.    I ordered the Cabo style Chicken - Chicken Breast lightly seasoned and char-grilled, topped with pineapple pico de gallo and served with spicy rice and steamed fresh vegetables.

It was eh...   The chicken was cooked but the pineapple pico de gallo was bland.  The rice was bland.  The vegetables were cold.   I really blame it on the fact I was with 15 compatriots for lunch so I am giving it a fair rating.  Everything was edible.

Everywhere you look, there are signs that say kids must be accompanied by an adult, but apparently no one was honoring that at 6PM on a Saturday. I couldn't even walk through the place without someone shoving me. AHHH!
I get that Dave and Buster's is an arcade and that you're going there to play some games, maybe eat, and kill some time. When I last went there a few years ago, we there for my bachelor party, and while I'm sure we got into some shenanigans, I don't remember children running wild there. We were having adult beverages, playing games, and having a good time. This time, it was ridiculous. It isn't Chuck E. Cheese, yet that's how parents seem to be treating the place.
On top of that, the customer service sucked. The place is gigantic, with tables and serving areas everywhere, yet on a Saturday at 6PM, the hostess told us (after interrupting us three times to chat with the other hostess) told us it would be a three hour wait, despite the fact that there were empty tables all over the dining room. I suspect this is a ploy to get you to play games and spend money until you're table is ready, but the food at Dave and Buster's is not worth a three hour wait on any day.
The hostess told us we could be served right away if we went to the midway and found an empty table, so we attempted that. Most of those tables were empty with usually one or two adults at a giant empty table filled with coats who informed us that they needed the table because their kids would be back soon after playing games. Next, i engaged in the most rudest thing I've ever done- I began stalking tables where people were finishing up. I would walk up to people paying their check, ask if I could have their table when they were done, and they would inform me that there were already two or three people who asked them and I should get in line.
Finally, we found a table and proceeded to spend two hours eating dinner. It wasn't because we ordered a lot of food- it was that the waiter took forever to bring our food out. He seemed to have no problem getting us fresh drinks, until we drank as much as we could and then asked for water. After that, he seemed to come around a lot less. 
I had the build your own chicken tacos, which comes on a giant plate with all kinds of fixings. The fixings were fresh, but the chicken was cold and dry, and the tortillas were dried out as well. For $14, it wasn't worth it. 
After dinner we proceeded to play games, which entails shoving people to get through areas and waiting in line to play anything. 
All in all, I didn't like my experience at Dave and Busters. I remembered it being a fun place to go and unwind as an adult. but between all the kids and the crappy service, can't recommend this place.

The place was far from crowded, and when a machine was out of tickets, it took us a good deal of time to find someone to assist us. When we did, the team at D&B could not have been more accommodating. To apologize for our wait they swiped us in for several games as well as gave us a handful of tokens for the game we were playing. 

I think a lot of companies (I'm looking at you, American Airlines) could learn a lot from D&B. It cost them virtually nothing to swipe us in for games, but it made our experience so much better.

Dining: 2 stars

I had a party of 20 coming in; I had called ahead of time, and arrived early. They immediately set up the table while about 4 of my friends and I waited; the hostess, after taking my name, never spoke to us again. She did not tell us when we could sit, how long it would be, or any other information. And then they made us wait for 75% of our party to show up before they would seat us. Mind you, there was no one else waiting, and the table was ready, and we were ready to order. But they didn't tell us this; I didn't even know why we were being forced to wait until I heard a supervisor whispering to the waitress about making us wait. I still have no idea why we were forced to wait. 

When my full party was finally seated, we were helped by two waiters who were perfectly polite and nice. BUT, our service was rather haphazard. People would order drinks and food, and get things at wildly different times. One person was done eating appetizers and drinks when another was just getting their first drink. I know there was chaos to a big party, but it got a little out of hand.

The food is pretty standard American chain food, comparable to Appleby's and Chili's - not offensive, but nothing to knock your socks off. It has a decent selection, and a few good desserts and appetizers, and everything was competently prepared. Overall, it is a fine enough meal for a large group before going to enjoy the arcade at fairly reasonable prices, but some of the service standards are poor. In the future we will probably eat at one of the other restaurants in the area and then move over to D&B's for games.

Bar: 1 Star

Drinks are predictably expensive, but there is a wide variety. The problem is that about half of them don't even kind of resemble what is on the menu, and most don't have enough alcohol to even taste. Worse yet, while you can get a drink at the bar in the arcade, the staff is either completely non-interactive or just rude. You have to track them down, and then have a minimum of interaction before they stomp off like you ruined their life.

Arcade: 4 Stars

There are a lot of great games here to play, and many that are fun with groups or pairs. It is a great place for a large party, because you can mingle with all your friends playing many different very fun games. If you are a couple, there are also many great selections that everyone enjoys. The staff on the floor is helpful and fast to fix games that have problems, and are typically polite. The ticket prizes are cheap as expected, but kind of fun, and the people in the ticket shop were always nice and quick to help.


Overall: 3 Stars

If you want to hang out here, I would suggest eating somewhere else, and then playing games and having fun here, but only order beer at the bar and don't expect a smile.",2,sbW8qHJgzEIH42B0S-3New,2,3,2012-09-29,review,3

First let me say that this isn't my first trip to a Dave & Buster's.  Second, I actually experience all of it while here.  We will start with the food/service.  Staff, you were wonderful.  You were polite, you greeted us as soon as we walked in the door, gave us no qualms while ordering and were swift with your delivery.  Food, you were not wonderful.  I ordered the BBQ chicken breasts.  This came with a side of broccoli and their type of mashed potatoes.  The chicken was a bit dry and in some places you can tell it was left on the grill a little too long.  There were actually some bites that all I could taste was charred meat.  There wasn't enough BBQ sauce on the the chicken either.  The broccoli appeared to have been cooked prior and then thrown back into a pan to be seared.  Some of my broccoli actually had some burnt crisp areas on it.  Also I noticed that there were still some leaves left on the broccoli.  The mashed potatoes I wanted to like (which I hoped would be the best part of the dish, I'm a bit of a potato freak), but alas, I was let down. *sad face* They were cold and such a tiny portion.  With a tiny amount of shredded cheese and bacon but into that divot they made with the scoop to get it out of it's container.  Oh food, how if I didn't need you to survive, I wouldn't complain about you.

The building right now is in disarray.  They are in the midst of a remodel with lovely plastic curtains covering up certain sections of their dining area.  No bar out in the dining area right now and the pool tables were absent as well.  If you wanted a drink you had to go back into the game room.

Speaking of the game room, by far the best part.  With the meal I ordered I got the $20 play card (the best part of the meal, super charge it for $3 more and it's even better).  The game room  you can tell is in need of an update.  The carpet is worn and other signs of wear are noticeable as well.  One good thing is the games.  They change them up so often that there is always something new once you return.  Who knew that playing Connect 4 could be so fun, or for that matter Skee Ball rises to the top of my list to play.

She said she'd come back right away with our refills...yea, right. 20 mins later we get our refills. Mind you, our food still hasn't came yet. I see other people getting their food that had come in after us. I was frustrated. After waiting 45 mins for our food, I asked to speak with a manager. One of the servers who I asked replied rudely with ""Well, he's really busy right now. I doubt he'll be able to come out and talk to you"". Finally, 15 mins later...that's one hour, folks.

The games were down for about 20 mins after the outage and staff was not friendly when we inquired about what happened or when the games would be working again.  After the outage, two people in our groups could not get their power cards to work. When we asked staff for assistance they just brushed us off and said we must have been out of credits.

-Yg14AIbCHsuohf6zqVvQw,6Mx5EMf5iO-ztO0kd4x1yw,"My boyfriend and I are in our 20s, and have visited this D&B multiple times. After our visit yesterday, however, I don't think we'll be back. When we arrived we were greeted by a long line of people waiting to buy game cards. At first there were 2 extremely slow workers trying to do this, then one left while the line was still out the door! The girl that was left was more than incompetent, and was taking extremely long to fill these game cards. We stood in line for over 20 minutes before being told that there was another attendant in the actual game room. Needless to say, the line in the game room was just as long, and they still only had one girl in the booth. It was a Saturday! After we finally got our cards we had to wait yet again to get a beer. 2 bartenders on staff while the bar was completely full. It took us almost an hour before we actually could start gaming. The floors were filthy with trash, and the bathrooms: repulsive! I had to use the restrooms twice during our visit, and not only did both bathrooms I used have no toilet paper in them, but there was TP all over the floors, and the sinks were less than cleanly. My boyfriend mentioned that the guys restroom was no better, as it smelled like pee and the paper towel dispenser didn't work. All I have to say is get your crap together. We could see a difference in the type of crowed that was there on Saturday compared to what it used to be, and I'm I have no doubt it's due to the poor service and attention to cleanliness. For how expensive they are they need to staff better on weekends. It's a shame how quickly this place has gone down hill and we will NOT be returning anytime soon!",0,sbW8qHJgzEIH42B0S-3New,0,2,2013-12-29,review,1

WzaaorVCmUTQvu4mScunNg,zEmohuEAk8wBYfQPxYzbZw,"ehh, 3.5 -- I can't rate it super low because i do smile a lot during my visits. Speaking of that, I've been here a few times, but never wrote a review for D&B. 

I'm a kid at heart and honestly do enjoy the games. However, there have been multiple instances where I swiped my game card & it took my credits, but no game began. There have also been times that I won and no tickets were released. I guess nothing is perfect but it does happen atleast once a visit (each scenerio)  It's hard to find a worker walking around and for half-price games, you kind of just take your loss with the 1.3 credits for skee ball (hmph!)

The food- it really isnt anything too fancy. I've had okay food, but super long wait times for a simple chicken fingers & fries for example. It's your basic sandwiches, salads, appetizers & a few pastas. I believe all sandwiches & burgers are around $10 & served with fries.  You can get the Eat & Play deal which includes food from a specific menu + a game card. Besides the game card deal, if you wanted to make D&B a date night you might be better off heading to another place to eat in Waterfront for amazing food.. but to each their own.  Try it once I suppose. The brownie sundae that i devoured last night was satisfying (2 brownies, 2 scoops of ice cream.. one with chocolate syrup; the other with raspberry sauce & fresh strawberries. Oh & whip cream)

Drinks- pretty weak. We ordered 2 liquid maryjanes (2 each that is) which are filled with multiple shots of alchy & didn't really catch a buzz. Oh welllll. They do have a happy hour from 5-7pm. I'd go during that time for the best deal. I believe cocktails are half off & $3 off  bottles of wine. I've never seen anyone walking around with a wine glass though lol. 

The prizes- as others have noted, the prizes are a little cheap for the amount of tickets they ""cost"" However, it's cool to leave with a D&B coffee mug, cup or shot glass. Last night for 2500 tickets we decided on magnetic-style dart board (1,300?) a coffee mug, a D&B glass (our plastic one bit the dust) & a D&B coffee travel mug.. I might be missing a few odds & ends.

Overall it's a fun time but can be pricey. It's best to head here Wednesday for half price games or get the Eat & Play deal while dining. 

I can't lie though, I find myself smiling ear to ear a few times within those 3 hours (woah, seemed longer than amount of time :D ) Speaking of which, in that time-frame we played 250 credits (cost= $40) but it was half-price games.",0,sbW8qHJgzEIH42B0S-3New,0,3,2014-03-27,review,1
Q3F_FZ8pbdRNoSv0X1Y7sA,qM6afyD5OmP-Y7IbefcUQQ,"Dave & Busters is a great experience  if you set your expectations realistically and carefully choose when you attend.

The main squeeze and I always 1) use a survey receipt for buy $10 get $10 in free gameplay or 2) Attend on a Wednesday during the day (flexible work schedules). We'd never dream of eating there because we like healthy yuppie food. And we only drink cheap drafts OR drink cocktails during happy hour.

Your visit is largely determined by time of day, expectations and whether or not you eat their food. If you come on a Friday night, the lines will be long. You'll pay $150 for the two of you to eat, drink and play for 3 hours and you'll be left with a very sour taste in your mouth.

The staff is really excellent; any issue with a game not paying out tickets results in immediate help and extra tickets or a swipe for a different game from an employee. 

Note the ""drinks are weak"" reviews. Also notice it was people buying shots and ordering multiple drinks per person. That's typical white trash behavior. Bartenders here are savvy; they mirror the behavior of the guests. All of our drinks have been consistently strong and well put together because we're courteous and tip well. I have witnessed bartenders bypass tattooed, loud guests and address me and take my order first. This is rational, logical behavior. 

Also note the ""prize center games suck"" comments. You're supposed to stack tickets over multiple visits and use them on a big prize. Like life, delaying gratification nets you bigger returns. Every other visit I've seen someone walk out with a video game system (Wii, Xbox360 and even a few Xbox One's). 

The thing about Dave & Busters is the crowd changes depending on day of week and time of day. Sunday afternoon it's all families and Friday and Saturday night it's all drunk 20 somethings. The atmosphere changes and that's why the reviews are all over the place.

This review is based on 8ish months of 1-3/monthly visits. Most visits are 5 stars, some are 4 stars.

Using survey receipts for Buy Ten Get Ten, avoiding Wednesday, Friday or Saturday evenings (and Sunday afternoon, families) and avoiding the food entirely and drinking cheaply, you'll have a great experience for $25-40/person.

I really enjoy the staff too, they split the difference between fun and professional. Special shout out to Riley, gave us info on possibly hosting a party there.",1,sbW8qHJgzEIH42B0S-3New,0,5,2014-04-15,review,3

Pgh Happy Hour is a facebook group of friends that like to check out new 'watering holes' every thursday and it's run by a guy that seems to party 24/7 while still holding down a very lucrative full time job.  

Anyway- Pgh HH was celebrating an anniversary and chose D&B for the location.  The D&B staff set up the back 'pool room' with complimentary,  enormous spread of appetizers with dips and kept refilling them when they got low.  Our server, Carla, was very attentive and friendly- making sure we were aware of the specials and checking back often when our glasses got to the half way point.  The other server back there was working equally as hard but I never got the chance to get her name.  

I had been here one other time for an organized happy hour for a past employer and remember very similar service but I never got the chance to give them any credit.  I think D&B is an awesome place when you need some space for your next event.",1,sbW8qHJgzEIH42B0S-3New,0,5,2014-07-08,review,1
fIKcxbs1u5oK74F-KgqGag,ZogsG2EF6VTKOYRim1SXEw,"Ok! Let me tell you about my bad experience first. I went to D&B last night for a post wedding party - which, side note, is a great idea!

It was around midnight and the bar wasn't really populated. There were three bartenders and only one was actually making rounds to see if anyone needed anything. The two other bartenders were chatting on the far side of the bar that no one was sitting at. Kind of counter productive if you ask me. 

I stood there for about 5 minutes, which for a busy bar is fine but when I am the only one with my card out then, it just seems a little ridiculous. I made eye contact with the one girl twice and gave her a smile and she literally turned away. I finally had to walk to them to get their attention.  I was standing right in front of them smiling and they didn't ask if i need anything. I finally said, ""Are you working?"" and they gave each other a weird look. I felt like i was the crazy one. I asked for a beer/got the beer.

In between that time, the other bartender brought food over and set it down. She took a fry from the plate (right in front of me) and then served it to someone on the other side of the bar. What the hell! I felt like i was in some grimy bar in out in the sticks - not an established D&B. 

I was just really turned off from that experience. 

The good is that D&B provides a different type of entertainment when you want to mix things up. I remember going here with my grandparents when I was a kid and it was the best treat ever! We would eat at the restaurant and then spend hours playing games. This place holds some really good memories for me.

Now, it is run down and many of the games are app related games (Fruit Ninja) and 3D Experience rides. With such ""games"", you can't even earn tickets and they take a lot of tokens! Last time I went, back in the winter, many of the games were broken, which made for a negative player experience.

He grabbed my plate and took it to his manager. But before doing so asked if I wanted something else I said no I had lost my appetite.

I keep seeing commercials for their new menu, so hey it couldn't be bad right? Wrong! Only thing that was really good was the Corona-rita - but that's hard to mess up. 

First off, service was horrible. I didn't feel like any of the areas were that packed to make the service so slow, but apparently I was wrong. It took about 15 minutes, minimum, to get our first drinks. At least an hour for our food. I have boneless buffalo wings, which are hard to screw up, so mine weren't bad but they weren't the best.

Better off going somewhere else in the Waterfront for food and then coming here to play. You'll save $$, time, and frustration!

I had a good time at Dave and Buster's, but that was based mainly on the company I kept and not the venue.   We went right when they opened for the day, with the intention of playing some pool.  We located the pool tables in an area that looked closed off, so we went to the hostess stand to ask.  She radioed for help, got none, and finally went in search of an answer our question.  When she came back, she said she couldn't find anyone, but a manager would be out to talk to us.   We wait...and wait...and finally just give up and go off to play in the arcade area.   

All but one of the card purchase machines were rebooting, and the one we could use didn't work.  It takes forever and finally gives up and directs us to a non-existent ticketing attendant.  So we again go off in search of someone to help.  We flagged down a server, who issued us a card ($56 for 375 tokens) and served us a few cocktails (average prices, though my rum and coke was teeny).   

And we are off to play some games.  About every third game we tried was broken in some way.  Either the token swipe didn't work or the game itself was messed up.   It also wasn't the cleanest place I've ever seen.  They have tables around the place to set your drinks on, but most of them didn't look as though they'd been wiped from the day before (which of course makes we wonder when they last cleaned all the games that germy little kids touch all day).

Overall, they appeared completely unprepared for opening (computers booting, employees not ready to work, soda gun at the bar not assembled, etc.) and not well maintained or managed at all.

I went to this one October 2014. I was in town for my favorite nfl team the colts steelers game. I went to the game and had fun in the city.

I went on half off Wednesday. I really had fun with the games. im a young man and I like old Nintendo games. I like all kinds of games. the skee ball game acted up.

I can say the food quality is sub par.  In my opinion the food prices are expensive for what it is and quality.  They do offer a nice bar,but then again the prices in my opinion are a little higher.  Service isn't too bad, but could be better.

D&B is a great place for adults for sure, but the prices for tokes or ""game play"" is a little ridiculous.  Some games charge 6.9 credits to place.  Thats almost saying $1.50 a game and some of those games are addicting where I know most of us keep playing.  

I also thing D&B isn't the cleanest place either.  The bathrooms near the arcade are always nasty in my opinion.  Doesn't seem like they keep up with it.  To me, thats a big factor in rating restaurants.

We gave the server the benefit of the doubt because there were about 8 of us, which can be challenging.  I think the long wait time to get the drinks and then the food was due to the bartender and kitchen, but the waitress really tried her best.

I only gave it 2 stars because I liked my mac and cheese.  Everyone else at the table hated their food.  They all had sandwiches or other dishes.  The one girl resorted to eating only the toppings off her sandwich because the bread was too hard to bite through.  The kitchen probably made her sandwich right away and left it under the heating lamps for 40 minutes while preparing the rest of our table's food.

I was tempted to stop and play games for a couple minutes, but after my husband came out of the restroom he told me how about 5 other guys walked out of the restroom as well that had not washed their hands and immediately went over to start playing games.

Speaking of added kicks, the quesadilla has jalapenos in it, which I loved!! I love spicy foods and most places just serve a little cup of jalapenos on the side.

That was also our first opportunity to point out to her that one of us had ordered a salad, and had been delivered a pasta dish, completely unrelated, instead. Fifteen more minutes and she finally delivered the salad that had actually been ordered.
 
But that's not the worst. One of the pasta dishes that *had* been ordered arrived without any sauce, just the naked pasta. We don't know why. Despite pointing out the problem, she never did do anything about that. Maybe she thought it was easier to eat with your fingers that way.

I've never sent back food, EVER, but this was ridiculous. The server takes my plate, and says they would make it right. I did NOT receive a fresh entree, it was put in the microwave and sent back to me. How do I know? The bread and meat in the sandwich was still torn apart, which I did while checking my food the first time to see if it was warm inside. They did however take it off my check, but never giving me a menu or asking me if I'd like to order something else, so my friends at the table gave me leftover ribs and fries off their plates. By the time the server came back so I COULD ask for something else, the table was already done eating, so I just sucked it up and when went on our way to play the arcade.  I highly recommend eating somewhere GOOD, and then just go to D&B to play.

If I was in the area and no one had a better suggestion for where to go, I might come back for beer and appetizers.

GOOD:
- Decent beer...
- Original pretzel appetizer.  You take chunks of soft pretzel and dunk it in spinach cheese dip.
- Huge portions.  Most of us had leftovers.  The RB Appetizer Sampler was multi-story and way more food that we could handle.  The half order of ribs looked like a full rack.
- Attentive service with quick seating and frequent drink/water refills.
- Amusing name.

BAD:
- Lots of food choices... burgers... steak... chicken... salads.  Lots of drink choices... beers... wines... mixed drinks.  I guess this could be seen as good, but it takes a while for everyone to pick something and since no one's awesome at everything, you could tell right away that nothing distinguishes this place.
- None of the food was super awesome.  Nothing was awful, but nothing stood out in any way.  I've had better beer, appetizers, and a better main course at plenty of breweries.
- Kind of dead on a Monday night with 3/4 of the place empty.

There are several dishes that are MONEY.
Appetizer:  Seared Ahi, Spinach Artichoke Dip
Entree :      Fire Steak, Pub Tips or Chicken Fried Chicken.
Desert :      Carrot Cake (to die for)
Bar food:     Pizza or ball park pretzels.  Both of which are sprayed with brown ale.  
Half the menu is really good, the other half is great.  
The beer is good.  Ask for the sampler!  They usually have a velvet and something on cask.  Ask for one of those if you are looking for something different.

gJhd8oM1yRDDGe3SPaC5Gw,j7TfEsZYkO0ARRBnPyYLQA,"First off, I will say that I just moved here from California and was a big patron at the Rockbottom in Long Beach. I came to the Homestead location last night eager to see the beer at this location.

Now, Rockbottom is a chain brewery, so a lot was the same... the menu, the food prices (yet beer is cheaper, and I am fine with that). I have always found their food to be pricey, but they use excellent ingredients and it has always been tasty and filling so I am fine with that. The food here was just as good as the Long Beach location, so I have no problem with the chef at all.

Service was good, our waitress was very friendly and helpful. I wish that they had asked us if we wanted to sit in the bar since happy hour was still going, but that isn't a big thing. Went to the bar to get a drink and had to wait awhile to get the bartender's attention, but he was very friendly and I got a nice welcome from him and others at the bar when they learned I had just moved here... I really enjoyed that.

Beer: We got the beer sampler to try the whole list... and, well... I found the dark beers a bit lacking in comparison. The light beer and the wheat were amazing, very impressed. The pale was ok, as was the velvet pale that was one of the specials of the night... but both were way too citrusy. The Uppity IPA was very good... I don't usually like IPAs because the hops overpowers all flavor but the brewer had a good balance. Still, couldn't do a whole glass. I felt the Imperial Stout had a bitter burned taste that was overpowering... I almost want to say the batch had too much chocolate malt in it (not ice cream malt, for the non-homebrewers). The brown and amber were decent, but bland. I ended up getting an actual glass of the light beer and was able to finish it all without forcing it.... one point up on Long Beach, who had a good light but the aftertaste got to you before the glass was empty.

I REALLY wanted to try the Das Gut Dopplebock, but they were out. Looks like they will have it in bottles to go soon so I hope I can catch that. Also want to try the Snow Moon Belgian.

Verdict: While I was not too impressed with the dark beers, I found the lighter ones very good and I look forward to trying the other seasonal beers. It is a good hour drive south to get there, so I won't be going too often, but I will be back.",0,McikHxxEqZ2X0joaRNKlaw,0,4,2011-01-18,review,0
scIDar9VGDMcTOHbem37pg,vDAA_k_8J1z0pz2tRH6ESg,"Even since Rock Bottom opened (7 years ago???) I have always thought it was a dance club.  I am not really sure why but I thought it was along the same line as (throw back) Hi-Tops but I did. I think I always thought this place was a club because of the behemoth size of the space. 

Well I was out with a friend and we needed a place to go before a show at the Improv and Rock Bottom was close. 

Part of this is my fault...I always order ""healthy"" items at places that specialize is greasy bar food...then I am upset when the meal isn't 5 star.  

I started off with one of their wheat beers, it was alright. I nursed it all through dinner so I don't think I was head over heels in love with it.  I got the Catch of the Day, Off the Hook, Fish Dish, Sailors Delight or something(I forget it had some cheesy fish themed name).  It was cod (meh, that should have been the sign not to get it) with roasted asparagus and lemon rice.  The fish was suppose to be broiled but it had a thick breading (annoyed) and the portion of fish was tiny. The rice and asparagus were great though. 

My friend got a chicken sandwich which he enjoyed although the fries were pathetic.  The fries were probably pre-cut frozen fries or just very poorly executed.  They were so thin that you have to grab a huge handful just to get any actual potato flavor.

Pros: A lot of tables (no wait), brew special beers, big menu, could hear the dueling piano bar next door

Cons: Place was fairly empty and we got a crappy table by the door when it was 5 degrees outside, most of the food was fried, cheese filled, cream based, or wrapped in bacon.  I know some people love to eat food like this all the time( I do every once in awhile) but if you eat out a lot you can't always get the spin dip, burger, and ice cream sundae.

cF2CgY-_zNTBtQpaP_CeVw,odIM8VqM-03YStvfBXIo5A,"Rock Bottom is a nice hangout place. Often when you are out and about with friends you arrive home with no voice from screaming over all of the background noise. Great if your out to see a band, but not so much fun if you actually want to talk to the people sitting around you. 


Depending on your mood you can sit in the dining area full of booths and tables. It's alittle separated from the main bar area so provides for a semi quiet dining area. The bar area gives you a choice of sitting at the surrounding tables with waitress service or hanging out at the bar itself. Complete with a chillie ice strip to keep those yummy brews cold and the ever entertaining company of your favorite bartender. When the weather cooperates the outdoor patio houses about 6 tables for outdoor dining. The view however...not so picturesque, just the entrance to the Improv. Which hey, that could be the perfect seat if you're stocking the local comics! 


The bar area contains pools tables and dart boards to try your skills. On any give night sports fans can enjoy the games of the day on one of the 6 big screen TVs surrounding the bar area. 

The menu is pretty decent with burgers that are cooked to order with the choice of either steak , veggie or chicken. They have a number of specialty burgers with different cheeses, toppings and creative themes. The bourbonzolla is a tasty burger with a Bourbon based glaze and Gorgonzola cheese. Appetizers which range from nachos to firecracker shrimp. Steaks, pasta and salads with rotating specials from different areas of the menu. 

On Monday the burgers are half off...I don't think you have to be a member of their mug club to get the special. However, if you are here regularly the mug club is great with free gifts and specials.

Rock Bottom is definitely a solid bar. As a microbrewery, their beer list is full of house brews. There are better beers in the world, but there are a lot of worse beers out there, too. 

What really makes Rock Bottom standout, though, is the food. My girlfriend and I shared an order of nachos, and it took everything we had to finish them. They also make a mean soft pretzel.

Every week when we go a menu is never needed because we pretty much know everything we want on it, except for when the change the menu from time to time and we get to have a special treat with something new! 

As an avid Rock Bottomer, hands down I have never in my life had a better spicy spinach cheese dip than I have had here at Rock Bottom. Whether I have eaten dinner or not before I come down to the restaurant, my favorite and my food of choice is the ENORMOUS Ball park pretzels with the cheese dip. It is a meal itself! The mixture of onions, cheese, spinach and tomatoes is perfection! 

Another favorite of mine is the Barbecue Chicken Pizza, it has a great kick to it and it's big enough for two people. 

The service has always been super great and now since we go often we have developed a great relationship with some of the wait staff.

I am not a beer drinking so I haven't tried the microbrews but the mixed drinks I've had have been good and a few of thier specials perfect.

rrGE6D7KhnrEMV75Kj3g7w,yGmtV3aZmCMqKhefn3dPQQ,"I always feel like I am constantly bashing breweries for their food, but in my opinion, I feel the bar is raised for places like this. It seems there are so many breweries out there that offer great beer, and slack off on the food. Unfortunately Rock Bottom is one that falls into that category. Let's be honest, when you go to a brewery, you want the full experience. If it was only about the beer, I'd go buy a growler and take it home. 

So, about the beer....EXCELLENT!!!!! The Jagoff IPA is with out a doubt one of the best IPAs I have ever had! They only I can think of that I think is better is Dogfish Head, but that's a matter of opinion. The beer selection is constantly changing, and they always have some excellent seasonal beers. You can't go wrong, there's bound to be a beer everyone will like. 

As for the food.......it's pretty much a crap shoot. Sometimes it's good, sometimes it's terrible. My biggest problem is there is absolutely no consistency when it comes to the food. One time it's perfect, then maybe it's cold, or it's burned, or it tastes completely different from the last time you had it. Unfortunately, it seems there is zero attention to food quality. 

That's pretty much it. This place fixes it's food consistency, and it's a five star place. Till then, it's hit or miss!",2,McikHxxEqZ2X0joaRNKlaw,1,2,2011-10-06,review,2

The hubster and I were here on a Saturday evening after a show at the Improv so we were happy and in a good mood and ready to enjoy some good eats.  We ordered drinks.  He a wheat beer of their brewing, me my fave Bloody Mary with Absolut Peppar.  The hubster deemed the beer acceptable, but wouldn't go out of his way to come back just for another one....yes, he DID order another one ""just to be sure.""  My Bloody sucked.  Watered down tomato juice with no discernible Peppar of any kind, let alone any other seasonings.  Even a good standard mix would have been better.  Our very efficient and friendly waitress took it back and watched while it was remade by the other bartender.  Nope, no better at all.  That went back and I went with a you-can't-screw-it-up Amaretto sour.  It was fine.

Hub ordered a Reuben - why, I'll never know because they simply never measure up to the gold standard of what used to be at the long-lamented Gazebo in Shadyside.  You younguns wouldn't have a clue of the establishment of which I speak.  He said this one was ""fine.""  I had the Texas Fire steak with jalapeno butter which I enjoyed very much!  Packed a punch of heat and flavor, but the sides were uninspired.  Steamed veggies.  Any flavor was steamed out in the process - eh.  Cheddar mashed potatoes - there was cheddar in there?????  No way!

The tab was reasonable - we DID have a Living Social deal that took $30 off, so our check was for $12 and change, not including tip.

_Ud7sdn_khya8e2f3FNvWA,D5RqMgldgDatdrbRlP3l1Q,"I've always been pleasantly surprised with the food I've gotten at Rock Bottom.  I say ""surprised' because with any restaurant that falls into the slippery territory of a ""chain"", you expect to find your fair share of culinary duds.  But I've really had a lot of good meals at Rock Bottom.  Now, granted, you do owe it to yourself when ordering to not forget where you are (a ""bar-straunt"" if you will), and don't get anything above and beyond this place's call of duty.  For instance, I will never be ordering the ahi tuna.  I'll leave that to my favorite sushi bars and restaurants a bit closer to the water (the Mon doesn't count.....).

But besides that, I always really enjoy my meal choices.  I've recently gotten the chicken avocado sandwich.  Chicken was grilled perfectly, plenty of avocado, and it was a good sized sandwich without being excessive.  I've also ordered the Margherita pizza, which could definitely be split between two people.  It's an eight cut that comes to you on a big wooden pizza paddle.  The pizza was really great.  The crust was crispy, it had a good balance of cheese and tomatoes, and the basil pesto was fresh and tasty.  And not greasy whatsoever - BIG bonus points there.  But my biggest surprise as of late was when I ordered their chicken flautas.  I'm a HUGE Mexican food fan and always hesitate to order Mexican outside of a Mexican restaurant for fear of being disappointed.  But I had an insatiable craving one night and decided to go for it.  It was DELICIOUS.  The flautas are deep fried which gives you an amazing crunch, and they still managed to not dry out the inner ingredients.  The accompanying rice was nice and moist as well.  I was so happy!

I've always been quite happy with the service there as well.  I go on Thursday evenings for trivia, and nine times out of ten the service is really spot on.  The ladies servicing the bar area are friendly and attentive.  Only once or twice, to my memory, has my service been sub-par, and that can usually be chalked up to an extremely packed Trivia Night with only two visible servers helping 50+ people.

It was even difficult to get beers at the bar...we tried to have the girls order, thinking they'd have better luck...when that failed, the men tried...that didn't work either. If we hadn't REALLY wanted a cold beer after a comedy show at The Improv, we would've just left. It definitely wasn't busy enough to be noticed and ignored by the bartender, so I can't overlook it. Of course, the service has always been spotty at Rock Bottom, so it was hardly surprising.

As I get older, my tolerance for things like crowds and youngsters gets lower and lower.  As a result, I told my brother to be ready by 4pm so we could head to the Waterfront before everyone goes out for date night.  Plus the Pirates were playing at 4:05 so we could enjoy our beers and the game.

When we arrived, the bar side was already pretty packed but we were still able to get a table.  Our server was very attentive, friendly and helpful.  Right off the bat we both ordered samplers so we could try all of their beers.  We loved the fact that as she approached our table with a full tray of samples our server said, ""I have to go back for the rest.""  In all we were served 10 different beers each (in 3 oz glasses, maybe 4 - I can never tell).  I gotta say, Rock Bottom knows their beer.  I liked more than I didn't, and very few were not to my liking.  So the $6.95 10 beer sampler was well worth it.  

During our sampling we indulged on some Southwest Egg Rolls.  They were okay, but not quite what I expected.  The spicy ranch was top notch, though.  As we ran out of beer, we each ordered up a Kobe Burger.  They were both cooked exactly to our liking (medium).  And to top off our wonderful evening, the Pirates brought home a win!

My only complaint, as a beer drinker, is the cost for a growler.  The glass container itself is sold for $12.95.  That's the empty price.  To me, that's a little ridiculous when East End only charges $3 for the bottle and Penn Brewery $5.  Paying more for the bottle than the beer inside seems like insanity to me.

DLu1Bum8EXNE62xno-v0VA,lE5xSKLsIBtv1SfJ9CHQBA,"Went here last night to meet folks for a friend's birthday party. Docking one star due to a few unfortunate things that happened, otherwise I'd be fine giving this place a 3.

Our waiter was very attentive and kept our water and soda cups refilled, the food was decent overall - I had a plain ol' burger and a delicious berry sangria - and the place overall had a nice vibe to it and was pretty comfortable and fun to be in...you'd think this would just be another average place not-great-but-not-bad and I'd be ready to go on to the next review right there.

Here's where I ran into problems. I'd checked the website in advance to try and plan my meal since I do my best to pick items on menus that aren't, say, 2,000 calories in one sitting. Their website advertises that they make skinny drinks; when I asked my waiter he said it was possible but that they did not normally do this and that it's a hassle for the people at the bar, so he didn't recommend it. Then why tell us on your website that you'll do it??? 

Additionally, while we had checked in advance when we made our reservation about bringing a birthday cake and the restaurant's ability to handle us lighting candles, apparently there was a break down in communication; we never got the candles we had asked for, and in fact the poor waiter struggled to even find a lighter before realizing there were no candles available. Obviously whatever error occurred wasn't the waiter's fault, and we definitely thanked him and tipped him well for doing the best that he could with what he had.
 
On a final note, this is also one of those places where if you ask for a medium rare burger, they will overcook it; I've started ordering medium rare on purpose specifically so that I get a medium cooked burger instead of medium well or well done.

Final verdict: go for the brews if you must, and the food's nice enough. I was admittedly left a little underwhelmed.",0,McikHxxEqZ2X0joaRNKlaw,0,2,2013-06-02,review,0

This was our second attempt at trying Rock Bottom on Fathers Day. The first time almost ten years ago. We went in the early afternoon and they had already ran out of steaks. How do you do that on Fathers Day?! This time we went around 12 noon and beat the rush.

My wife got and loved the Berry Bash Sangria. She just said it had too much ice in it. Our daughter got the root beer float which she love and I started with a Mango Ice Tea, but later switched for a raspberry ice tea as the mango ice tea wasn't sweet enough.

We started off the the Kobe beef sliders as our app. It took at least 15 minutes to get them. You get three sliders and they were very good.

My wife got a small greenhouse salad with Jalapeno ranch dressing to start off with which she enjoyed and the lobster & shrimp enchiladas as her main entree. She complained about how salty it was and the fact that there was no lobster in it at all.

Our daughter got the kids burger and fries. No surprise there.

I ordered the New York Strip with mashed potatoes and it came with green bean as well. My strip was cooked perfectly and has a decent taste. Longhorn has a much, much better quality of steak though. The green beans were pretty good and my mashed potatoes very bland and pretty average. 

The kitchen sounded like an live episode of Hell's Kitchen. The waiters were repeatedly asking for orders at least 5 to 6 times. The kitchen was backed up the whole time we were there.

My shower was wonderful, the wait staff was great and kept everyone's glasses full.  It started pouring down rain and they let us stay a little longer so my gifts wouldn't get wet when taking them out to the car.  The only reason this place gets 4 stars is because we were not allowed to take our leftover food from the buffet home.  There was salmon, chicken, potatoes, and mac and cheese left over and they told us we couldn't box it up.  Not sure why- they can't re-serve it!  It would have just gone to waste!

pNIud6KW96svNcvb2WQ-XQ,cx-uK63Pl7gBAsz0lUiDBw,"Tom and I decided to try this place out before catching a late movie on a Saturday night. He is a beer buff, and neither of us had ever been there, so we gave it a go.

We walked in around 8pm and we were told that there would be an hour long wait. We put our names on the list and went shopping around the area. About 25 minutes later, our table was ready. Parking was a cluster since the lot is shared with Dave & Busters and a karaoke bar called Sing Sing. Tom dropped me off at the door so I could secure our table.

Our server, Jackie, approached me almost immediately and brought two waters to the table to start. She was very attentive and funny, and probably the best part of our experience at the restaurant. Tom ordered a Red Ale and to his surprise, didn't care for it. Jackie gave Tom three free samples of beers she thought he would like after talking to him about his beer drinking habits. He loved all three, and chose the most bizarre (and expensive) beer. Jackie switched the Red Ale to the beer of Tom's choice, and charged us for the less expensive beer. Very nice of her!

We started out with the Ball Park Pretzels with Jalapeno dip. The pretzels came out quickly and they were very fresh, not to mention huge! We only ate one and took the other to go. Very good app though! 

Tom ordered some sort of bacon cheeseburger, and I got the Chicken Fried Chicken, which was a pounded chicken breast, breaded and fried, over white cheddar mashed potatoes with a side of gravy and some apple coleslaw.  Tom's burger came with a small handful of fries, and my meal was very spread out on my plate, like something was missing. Not very good presentation at all. The food itself was okay, nothing to write home about. The potatoes were my favorite part. Tom said that his burger was mediocre.

Another note: The bathrooms are shared with the Sing Sing karaoke bar that is in the same building, so expect drunk singing women in the bathrooms and brides-to-be puking in the stall next to you after enjoying too much alcohol at their bachelorette party... Yuck.

Overall, we might come back for the beer and service, but not for the food. And DEFINITELY not to use the bathroom...",0,McikHxxEqZ2X0joaRNKlaw,1,3,2013-11-10,review,0

2rSeth60_CuWN3ZJ4k41lg,YXRTA4I09YOXx_zCfsPEwA,"So after an evening of enjoying a comedy show at the Waterfront, we headed to Rock Bottom for some late night grub.  The place was pretty busy, we had to walk around the bar area for several minutes until a nice couple told us they were about to leave and we could have their bar table.  As nice as this was of them it was awkward standing over them as they finished their drinks paid their bill and left.  

So finally seated I look over the drinks and being the huge IPA lover that I am I went with that and it was indeed a good choice.  The hubby had the Red Ale which was also rather good.

The service was OK, not the best not the worst.  But moving on to more important thing, the food.  Talk about missing the mark hugely!  I ordered the mini street fish tacos.  You get four mini tacos with a marinated in lime piece of fish, and tomatillo salsa.  They were just strokes away from inedible.  I love fish tacos, I mean it is such a simple concept so why do people have such a hard time executing this dish? The shells were hard and literally split at the bottom when I picked them up.  The sour cream sprayed all over the plate only made them messy and the poor fish was just so overcooked.  If I wasn't so hungry I wouldn't have eaten them at all! Lesson learn on that.

The husband had the BBQ Chicken Pizza.  It had beans and corn with roasted red pepper on it along with some sour cream.  My husband is usually the type that will order these lovely specialty pizza's and ask for them to remove all the wonderful unique toppings!  For instance, he would usually just say, Chicken BBQ and cheese, nothing else!  I refused to let him do that this time, because I was really intrigued in the combination of ingredients on this pie.  And boy was I jealous when it came out.  It blew my crappy tacos out of the water!  Should have stuck with something simple.  

Furthermore I could care less if I come back to this location.  The beers were good but hell you can get a decent IPA just about anywhere anymore.  And the underwhelming food sealed the deal.

The beers on tap are always great. My newest favorite is the First! Pumpkin Ale. 

One thing I really appreciate about Rock Bottom is that they aren't one of these restaurants that try to rush you out when you're done eating. The food comes out fast (which is great when you're starving!) but if you want to stay an visit with your date or eating companions there's never any rush. I was just at Rock Bottom last night meeting friends for a movie that didn't start until 11pm. We got at the restaurant around 7:30, ordered drinks, ate and had a few more drinks and then just hung out for about a half hour until it was time to Walk over to the cinemas. It was nice not feeling rushed to leave as soon as we stopped ordering.

My only complaints are that sometimes meat ends up being cooked a little more than you often ask. Medium often turns into medium well, but that's not a huge problem for me. I also don't think the signature cocktails are worth $9, but that's more of a corporate complaint since Rock Bottom is a small chain.

Their beer is always good- as far as their staples go, I really love their white ale. Their seasonal IPAs have been good and my favorite seasonals of all time included their chocolate raspberry stout (...yes, it tasted as good as it sounds; they had it last year around Christmas) and their smoky BBQ brown ale (tasted like summer, complemented BBQ amazingly ; they had it this past summer, I bought a growler of it lol). 

As far as their food goes, I typically stay away from the appetizers. $10 and up is a little too pricey for me as far as appetizers go. I've had their southwestern rolls and they were good but not worth $10. 

Almost every time I go I order the Baja chicken sandwich. It's my favorite chicken sandwich! So good. The chicken is actually grilled (which goes for all of their chicken sandwiches) and I love the charred flavor that it has. The bun is soft but sturdy and doesn't fall apart while eating the sandwich, the sauce is amazing, the onion frizzles are the best and last but not least... There's a half of a fresh avocado on this sandwich. Mhm! I love it. My boyfriend usually gets the hickory BBQ bacon chicken sandwich and loves it as well. 

Another item I ALWAYS get... Their apple coleslaw. I've yet to find better coleslaw in a restaurant. So simple, yet oh so good. 

They also recently changed their fries and these are much better than their old ones. 

Their side salads are awesome as well. They are decent in size- spring mix topped with sunflower seeds, raisins, half of a hard boiled egg (which I give to the boyfriend), chopped cucumbers and tomatoes and croutons. Yum! 

I usually order the same thing every time I go. I steered off my normal path once and ordered the buffalo Mac and cheese and found it to be quite tasteless. Which turned me off to trying new items there. Plus I am just too in love with the Baja chicken sandwich and apple coleslaw to want to try anything else.

I came to rock bottom, looking for a great beer. Full of hops, that brings a refreshing sensation and satisfaction. I then opened the menu, scanned looking for those select bar items to pair with my great beer. I saw an extensive list of items, from chicken fingers to salads. I noticed a Ball Park Pretzel, with a jalapeño cheese dip. I was blown away, the fact that I got 2 pretzels amazed me. I ordered within 25 minutes of seating. My pretzels hit the table within minutes. The smell of the warm salt and hot cheese opened my senses. But I knew we could step this shit up, I asked for mustard. And what do you know. Grey Poupon Dijon Mustard is in front of my eyes. I combined that shit and life evolved.

The appetizer tacos were rather dry.  The cajun tacos were much better but executed oddly.  They come in 2 shells -- an inner hard shell and an outer soft shell.  Why might I ask?  Why add extra calories for something that seems so unnecessary and doesn't add to the dish in any way.  

Oh, well.  Can't speak about beer here as I'm not a beer drinker.

Whether increasing the number of diners at the last minute or providing separate checks, they are flawless. Lots of other restaurants could learn from them. Impressively, even with providing separate checks to such large groups, they chose not to add gratuity (and we obliged with good tips), l managed to deliver food to everyone at the same time, and processed payment of the checks in no time at all. Bravo to this restaurant's management and service staff, it's top notch.

DLu1Bum8EXNE62xno-v0VA,EWz5E5u15q3D4KKSrOPORQ,"It's been a couple years since I first reviewed Rock Bottom, and while I still don't love the place they've definitely improved since then. They admittedly still aren't my first choice food-wise because, by design, they're a pretty generic eatery for the most part, especially compared to other options in the area. Their local brews are really the only thing that sets them apart from other places in the Waterfront, and Pittsburgh has so many breweries and so forth now that even that isn't the biggest draw anymore.

That said, their brews ARE usually quite good and worth trying. Plus, they ARE improving in terms of service and quality of food, and that deserves a mention. Sure, I may think their menu of burgers, pizzas and American eats is pretty average, but I also think the quality of the dishes is improving. For example, my burgers are no longer coming to me overcooked, and as a result actually taste like a burger and not like a pile of toppings and a dry meat patty. Some dishes are even more memorable now; I actually really like their veggie burger, which is packed full of flavor that even I, a known carnivore, can appreciate. And their fresh pretzels and dip? Absolutely amazing - exactly what you'd expect from a warm pretzel fresh out of the oven. 

I was especially impressed during my last visit by a server named Mark, who was incredibly attentive and came to our table regularly to check on drinks and keep us updated. He never said a negative word and was quick to correct any mistakes or problems that popped up during the night. If Rock Bottom hires more people like him, there will be many more happy people coming and going from the place, I guarantee it.

Add in the fact that this is one of a small handful of places that accepts reservations in the Waterfront - a MAJOR plus when planning big outings with friends in the area! - and you have a reliable place where a group of people can go after a movie, shopping, etc. for food and drinks. And for that, Rock Bottom's earned another star in my book.",0,McikHxxEqZ2X0joaRNKlaw,0,3,2015-05-03,review,1

You might say, ""I've never heard of Rock Bottom, there's no way that they are a chain restaurant."" Beer? Apps? Bros? Sounds like a good time, but be careful or you'll end up on the rock bottom.

After a 30 minute wait staring at half of an empty restaurant with the usual goofy decor you would find at a Buffalo Wild Wings, we were finally seated. We could feel the tension from other diners that something wasn't right. The manger was running around apologetically and the food was casually sunbathing under the heat lamps. We immediately ordered a few apps but just like GOT, and now our watch begins.

We waited and waited to finally receive the saddest, tiniest plates of food with bloated chain restaurant prices. The food was uninspired, tired, and ordinary. The only reason why I am giving them 2 stars is because of the extremely gracious and apologetic wait staff who took off 20% of our meal due to the terrible service.

As always it is a haircut weekend so the twin carnivores, the mother in law and I decided to tie the feed bag on at RB. Our server Matt was easy to work with and informative. 

I started off with the tortilla soup. Spicy and thick it went down easy enough. However let me say that the price at $3.50 was rather steep for the serving size. Did somebody say OUCH!! Thing one and thing two each had the 'small fry steaks'  with fruit (cantaloupe, melons, and grapes) and steamed broccoli and at $6.75 each, I think I was 'buffaloed' IF  you get my drift. The steak consisted of three small thinly sliced pieces of .... Hmmm. 

They say that kids say the darnedest things well thing one noticed that his steak was very very gristly, and thing two noticed that his was rather dry. Not the best dinner they have eaten. They say you get what you pay for OR NOT!!  

My meal consisted of the Chicken Bacon Mac & Cheese  and at $14.75 I had no complaints. It was filing hot and load with chicken and bacon. How can anything be wrong with that much BACON!!! 

The final dinner consisted of chicken fried chicken and at $13.95 my mother in law was sated. Over all this meal was a wash. If anyone from Rock Bottom corporate reads this... You may seriously want to rethink you portion sizes.

We are abandoning this restaurant.

I don't expect this Rock Bottom to be around too much longer.  In the past, on nights when the Pirates were playing out of town, the bar and the restaurant would be packed.  Last night, it was only slightly busy.  You can usually tell when an eatery is suffering by the amount of staff on a given night and the conditions of the bathroom.  The staff was overwhelmed and the bathrooms were filthy and in serious need of repairs.  Alas, I don't think that Rock Bottom will still be in business in six months.

I order practically the same thing every time (Bacon Mac 'n Cheese, Brewery Nachos, and a beer...usually an IPA or a Manhattan) and the last two times I was at RB, the food was disappointing: it was cold and unappetizing, my Manhattan sucked, and the service was worse. The food is always better over at SingSing for some reason...even if they do come from the same place! 

I was craving the Mac 'n Cheese, so I went down to pick some up. I had a gift card, so I figured I wasn't out any money if the food sucked. I saw that there was a new menu, so I sat down to order. I got the Street Food Quesadilla, Bacon Mac 'n Cheese, and Beer Battered Onion Rings. I also ordered a Homemade Root beer and a few samples of the house beer.

Everything was amazing! It came out hot and tasted awesome. They have a new Head Chef and it shows. I was floored...the new Street Food options are fun and tasty. They are unique and different...not something you'd find at any restaurants in the area.

The Service was good. My waitress was named Liz and she certainly was on point. She even helped me find a beer after I was sorely disappointed by the IPA offering...which was weird. I always thought the House Brews were tasty and fun, no matter their style or make. I'm an IPA girl, but I would happily drink anything that came from their taps. I was disappointed in the offerings, but I ended up settling on the Pale Ale that was quite tasty.

In the end, if you were turned off by Rock Bottom before, I'd definitely recommend going back to check out the Street Food and new menu offerings. Service has dramatically improved, food quality has improved,  and I was thrilled.",0,McikHxxEqZ2X0joaRNKlaw,0,5,2015-06-04,review,0

There were a lot of great choices on the menu. I chose the grilled chicken sandwich which had barbecue sauce, bacon, cheddar cheese, pickles, lettuce, tomatoes, and red onions. The chicken it self had a great grilled flavor. I think it was good enough to eat plain. The barbecue sauce was smokey with a hint of sweetness. The pickles added a tangyness. It was a huge sandwich. It was served with fries but they were a little soft. They needed a few more minutes of cooking. 
I only ate half of my sandwich so I would have room for dessert. They have a couple of smaller desserts that are served in Mason jars. Then they have a few that are larger that you could share with 2pr 3 people. I ordered the cheesecake with caramel and toffee. Yum!!!!

csNALHN2BVA7hVgC9ge-VQ,cNlBP075Q0g_UpupGEhvXA,"Ergh, this place. I hate giving bad reviews but on my latest visit, I should have listened to my gut and not repeated my visit here. Naturally, I'm not a stranger to this chain, understand it's a chain, but the past visit here was just not good.

Came with my brother on a Sunday after a driving lesson. We were hungry and this was his way of paying for gas money. We were seated in the dining area. Every time we are seated in the dining area it's a bad experience. On the bar side you get entertainment, the beer flights/draft specials are decent and the bar food/appetizers are passable.

It started off with the soft drinks. I'm not a pop drinkers so when I want a simple diet pepsi I expect it not to taste funky [and yes, I prefer the weird twang of diet drinks to sugar in a glass taste of regular]. There was incorrect carbonation, whether they were running out [I suspect this], no ice [lukewarm] or they had just hooked up a new box [unlikely]. I sent it back.

My brother got a burger which he said was fine, it came with an egg on it and he found himself satisfied. I tried to steal a few of his fries, which were a failure. They tasted like the off brand in the freezer section [a full mouth of starch], and were barely crispy enough. So abandon plan. On my own dish I had the classic mac n' chicken. First of all, the pasta was crispy?, really?, it wasn't a cheese sauce, it was pretty much butter baked on and sprinkled in Parmesan and smothered in breadcrumbs. And when I say smothered here, this is not a good thing. Sigh. The chicken was pushed to the bottom of the pan, which my brother tasted because I was turned off my this version of my favorite dish, and said it was cooked properly. A small save? 

Again - I sent it back after about 3 bites. The waitress came back asking if I wanted a box, I told her to take it away. She did and disappeared into oblivion until we had to flag her down for the check, which I didn't see as my brother paid for it while I used the restroom, I hope they didn't charge us for the pop drink.... Needless to say, I came home hungry.

Also had the Gentleman, Holly's Mistletoe and Lively. The Gentleman was good in my opinion.  2 out of 8 beers impressed me and above standard for my tastes while the others were below standard when it comes to craft beers.  Again this is my opinion. I have a wide range of styles I enjoy but IPAs are a solid choice for me.  Pricing for flights was excellent at $6 for 6 4oz. tasters.

The service was lackluster. Myself and two friends were sat and the waitress took my order and the other man but ignored the girl that was with us and walked off without even asking her if she would like anything. She was a bit put off to say the least. We tracked the waitress down and she apologized but the rest of the stay was a bit awkward.

It was a short hike from the theater, but I am not cold tolerant, and was glad of the warm, comfortable restaurant interior.  It was pretty empty (my favorite), and we were ushered to a booth, which was roomy and comfortable.  

Our server was friendly, attentive, and made great recommendations.  The beers were very tasty!  Even though we were starving, our server recommended getting 1/2 order of nachos if we planned to get dinner.  GOOD TIP!!!  The half order of nachos is piled on to a traditional dinner plate, and it was plenty of appetizer for 2 people.  My friend got the country fried chicken with mashed potatoes and slaw.  She seemed to enjoy it.  I got the veggie pizza with feta, which was good, but I think I would have been happier with something else.  There was no fatal flaw in the pizza, I think I was stuck eating bread with grilled veggies and feta while my friend ate fried chicken- and that was entirely my fault. 

Overall, this was a positive experience.  It has a ""chain"" feel (because it is a chain), but I would go back and recommend it to others.  It is for foodies? Nope.  It is amazingly original?  Nope.

I think I went back the next night because I had such a good experience. It's pretty much always packed around happy hour/dinner time because it's a great spot. 

The Pittsburgh location doesn't quite compare. The actual layout, food, service, etc., is average. I ordered the bison burger last night and it was pretty good.

They were out of Mac and cheese because they had had a busy night. I didn't mind that at all because I had tried the Mac and cheese before; you should give it a try if you haven't. 

The waitress was great. She checked in often to make sure we were comfortable. The menu is large. You're sure to find something you want to try.

I called a handful of shops to get a quote to replace an exhaust manifold gasket and bolts on my 05 Grand Cherokee. Alan (owner) quoted me $250 per side (I have the 5.7 V8, so there are 2 sides) to fix it. Sure enough, it was $250 out the door. Alan is a great guy that knows his stuff. If it doesn't need to be fixed, he'll tell you it doesn't need to be fixed. BUT, if it does need to be fixed, it really does need fixing. He even checked on a couple of other things and made some recommendations for other specialty shops for projects I plan on doing on this Jeep, which he didn't have to do. 

I chose to give Master a shot after my normal go-to shop in Monroeville didn't return my call seeking a quote for the exhaust manifold. Some of the reviews on Google for Master are unfair, with the chief complaint being a misunderstanding of personalities. If you want to question what the mechanic tells you needs to be done, fine. Just make sure you know what you're talking about. If you have zero mechanical knowledge, don't tell the mechanic how to do their job. Alan won't blow smoke up your dress and hold your hand. If you want your car fixed, take it to Master. 

Thanks again, Alan, for giving me the opportunity to boast on the Jeep forums about only paying $250 for a repair that many have shelled out $1K+ to fix! You're my new go-to shop for our vehicles.

Also, as to be expected, the food's not that great. In a perfect foodie world, places that served food would make it fantastic! Since that's not going to happen, you just go into those places hoping for the best. I've never had anything great here. Nacho platter too many re fried beans, to little nacho's....annnnnd I'm out! 

So what did we learn here? Good venue, stick to beer and wine and eat at a better restaurant beforehand. The talent is really what you're there for so, enjoy the show!",2,tv8cS4aaA1VDaInYgggb6g,1,3,2011-04-20,review,5

The food leaves little to be desired. We decided for the sake of time to grab dinner at the venue since the show started at 7. Having a free appetizer coupon we ordered the spinach and artichoke dip along with the sauteed grilled chicken. Spinach and artichoke dip was good though cheesy rich along with cheese sprinkled on top of the chips. Sauteed grilled chicken - hmmm.... I think the chicken was frozen - definitely not fresh - and the guacamole was artificial with a glop of cheese. It looked like a mess with big ole pile of fries. A lot of food for $10.

We hit the comedy club for an evening of Tammy Pescatelli - the hubby and I have enjoyed her routine on TV and on the occasional DVE morning show..  She didn't fail to give us a good evening of laughs!  The big surprise, was Gene Collier - yep, of the Post-Gazette sports writer fame - as the opener.  What a great opening act!  He cracked wise about the perils of being 58 and a baby boomer.  We could relate!

The sightlines were lacking.  There was a rather large woman at the table in front of us with massive Pittsburgh BIG HAIR.  All night long my own head bobbed from side to side as I attempted to actually watch the show, and not just listen to it, as she reached repeatedly and unceasingly for her tableful of snacks.  

With a 2 drink minimum, my first drink was weak and the 2nd was quite strong!  All in all, the two balanced each other out.  But then, you don't go for the drinks, do you?  An enjoyable evening!",0,tv8cS4aaA1VDaInYgggb6g,1,3,2011-11-01,review,0

That includes the $10/drink, two-drink minimum, automatic 18% gratuity, and the comic spouting out the obligatory, ""don't forget to tip your waitress.""

Trying to judge the place on its own merits and not on the entertainment value of the comics.  (If the latter, since we were here for Frank Caliendo, I'd have given the place the full 5 stars if only for him alone!)

Total cash bled out of my pocket brought it down from what could have been a 4-star experience for us.  $80 for tickets online included $10 ""service fee"" and tax (we had to: this was a sold out show).  Add $25 for drinks, gratuity, and more tax.  We're talking 3-digits of $$$ for less than 2 hours of entertainment squeezed in between other patrons and glass-wielding servers while you sit on rickety chairs.  That's what a headliner act will cost ya!

I am thankful to have a venue to see some of my favorite comedians.  Most recently I saw Hannibal Burris, Tommy Johnigan and Doug Benson. All three performances were a hooting good time. 

On Saturday afternoon at 2:20pm I went to see Doug Benson I was accompanied by my boyfriend. You may know Doug Benson from the hit documentary ""Super High Me.""

Wonderfully talented comedians 
Clean bathrooms

Expensive food 
Flavorless food

e7iHB7gZbVuD-UvJVKe3cQ,NeiNiLOX_HS2KvF320k3vw,"The place does what it does best - Comedy.  The food, however.  Blah.

First off, If you go to a show, please note there is a two item per person minimum.  This means that from their extensive menu of overpriced bar food and drinks, you are REQUIRED to choose two items each.    

Second, the sodas are NOT FREE REFILLS!  I learned that one the hard way.  Get water. 

Third, before tipping your server, please make sure she hasn't already taken her cut out.  Even after paying for two very bland, overpriced meals and way too many Diet Cokes, I thought that my bill was rather high.  Upon further inspection, I noticed that my server had taken an 18% gratuity.  The menu explicitly says that an automatic gratuity will be taken out for parties of six or more, but there was only two of us and we weren't even drunk.  I found this tactic awfully presumptuous and left her tip at the 18% even though I typically tip well over 20%.    

Overall, I don't like the idea of being required to purchase food just to see a comedy show.  I can see why they do it, but if I were required to buy a crappy popcorn and overpriced pop every time I went to the movies, I would be far less inclined to go as I am not inclined to go to the Improv again.",0,tv8cS4aaA1VDaInYgggb6g,0,2,2012-08-09,review,0
8syjbjJRkzxK9RUaKewUrg,SwrlnLby5YNCMo8IYBGzIg,"The Pittsburgh Improv is unfortunately another great idea hamstrung by the details of mediocre execution (some specific examples at the end).

The setup is nice, a delightful--if a bit sterile--reproduction of what you'd think a comedy club should like if you watch enough TV.  The interior is clean; the seats are comfortable; and it's an OK atmosphere to see a show and laugh.

It's too small, however, to attract many of the best acts, which limits its ability to ever become the central hub for Pittsburgh comedy.  Most of the big names that have recently come through Pittsburgh--Jim Gaffigan, Louis CK, Second City--all perform elsewhere (though they managed to get Bob Saget, to their credit).

But the biggest problem is the food and drink.  They're very up front about their mandatory two item minimum, but the forced service requires that you spend extra money and get interrupted by waitstaff at least several times during the show.  The prices are well above what I'd consider reasonable given the quality, and I'd begrudgingly--or even happily--just shrug off the cost the same way I would a stadium concession stand markup...but the food is bad.  You're forced to either (a) buy extremely overpriced drinks (3.50 for a soda, for example, with no refills--or ten dollars for one with refills), or (b) buy moderately overpriced food which you wouldn't want in the first place.  I thought the ten dollar chicken sandwich looked reasonable, until a few bites in I decided I'd rather just throw away the money than keep eating it.

Still, I think this place has a lot of potential; the core idea is very workable; and they do attract some really good comedians.  Two stars for now, with high hopes for improvements.

A few specific drawbacks which could be VERY easily fixed:
1 - A lot of the drinks didn't have prices on them.  I know this isn't uncommon, but at a venue where every question you ask interrupts not only your own show-viewing experience as well as the experiences of your neighbors, it's an incredibly poor decision here.  Make everything on the menu exceptionally clear.  It's not that hard.
2 - Put the drink prices on the website too.  An Improv representative has personally responded to many of these Yelp reviews, and she once said ""Our menus and pricing are listed on our website, which makes for easy planning!""  I'm calling shenanigans.  Not all the prices are on the website, which makes for difficult planning.
3 - Reminding me to tip my server during the show AND adding an automatic gratuity to the check makes me feel like you're trying to trick me.  It's kind of an unprofessional way to say goodbye to one's customers.
4 - Since the $3.50 soft drinks don't come with free refills, the servers shouldn't ask ""would you like a refill on that?"" or anything of the sort.  They should ask ""would you like another one?"" instead.  They should also respond to requests for refills by saying ""we don't offer refills, but I'd be happy to get you another one.""  Just because there's a 10 dollar refillable soda option on the menu doesn't mean people all figure it out.  Most patrons don't even bother reading the beverage section of the menu if all they want is a standard beverage offered almost everywhere (like a cola or diet cola), and the reading difficulties imposed by the darkness make them even less likely to browse the offerings.",0,tv8cS4aaA1VDaInYgggb6g,0,2,2012-09-05,review,3

Things you should be aware of: The staff is really strict on the 2 drink minimum so be prepared to spend money on the pricey food and drinks. I kinda wish their menu was a little bit more extensive. Their service is spotty

The wait staff is a little iffy. I have been here MANY times and sometimes I get an attentive waitress and sometimes not. Most recently our waitress was rude, didn't bother with pleasantries and barely took notice of us. Also beware of the fact they automatically add gratuity.

The comedians are good, for the price, and many times you get a steal and can see a great comedian for a low price (i.e.Tommy Johnagin). However, be advised, if you attend more than one show every couple of months, you will see some of the same opening acts repeated. This is my biggest gripe with the Improv. I've been to the Improv about 3 times over the past 4 months and have seen the same opening acts a few times. I think they cycle through the same 4-5 comedians. Are there not more talented comedians in Pittsburgh? As noted in other reviews, another area of improvement is the drinks and food. I always attend the late showing so that I can eat elsewhere. The food is mediocre bar food at best. Nothing more needs to be said about that. I definitely don't mind the two drink minimum. I've been known to consume more than two drinks in one setting but, the drinks are insanely overpriced. $5 for a Miller Lite, $4 for a Snapple, $10 for a fountain drink with refills. You're better off having your two drinks during the show and going over the Sing Sing after for a draft .  . or four. In addition, since they started offering a large Groupon discount, the Improv has been packed.

cNsuaATGLVUUpDSkChEk-g,Qw0-BqNgV7dxBXFWzXH2Hg,"We came to the Improv for the first time on Friday night for my wife's work holiday party. We arrived early for dinner and drinks from a predetermined menu. Dinner started with a salad of clearly bagged, almost brown iceberg lettuce, with some croutons and frozen-then-thawed looking tomatoes that were pinkish at best. I took a few bites of this unappetizing poor excuse for a salad, and I can tell you it was downright tragic. Dinner arrived and since there wasn't any vegetarian options on this predetermined menu, we received a dish that was supposed to contain meat with the meat omitted. It was a huge pile of spaghetti in a bowl. It looked sloppy and tasted worse than it looked. The pasta was overcooked, and the tomato sauce was just watered down puréed canned tomatoes. I saw traces of onion in my dish but didn't taste them at all. I was so hungry that I salted the heck out of this abomination and took a few bites. Yuck. I didn't make a dent in this crapfest. For dessert we were given a choice of chocolate cake, which my wife ordered, and cheesecake, which I ordered. The chocolate cake had freezer burn. Inexcusable! It wasn't edible. The cheesecake was only a hair better, but it had obviously come out of the freezer as well. I know people aren't coming here for the food, but if you are FORCING them to order things off of your menu to fulfill some outdated requirements (two drink/two menu item minimum) then at least make some halfway decent food. It doesn't even have to be memorable...just not OFFENSIVE. Which it was!! Had I paid for any of this I would have made a huge stink, but I tried to be polite and push my food around and make small talk. 

The comedians were good. The venue was nice-ish and we got to sit in the front because we arrived early for our ""event"". Not always the best thing in a comedy club (we only got picked on a little bit). But damn, I was hungry! I found myself fantasizing about all of the crappy Waterfront restaurants and how I'd rather be there...how I'd rather be heating up a discount microwave dinner...how I'd rather have a giant bowl of Captain Crunch...how I'd rather go back in time and eat spaghetti from my high school cafeteria...what a dreadful dining experience.

My car was also violated in the parking lot. I had an adorable German license plate on the front of my adorable German car which was stolen while I was eating hideous food, which was just the slap in the face I wanted when finally retreating to my car. I feel sick in so many different ways about this experience as a whole.

The Improv should consider outsourcing the food prep to a catering company. I truly believe that's the only thing that can save this place. Do yourself a favor and eat beforehand, and just order a beer. Well, two I guess. Other diners at our table complained about the quality of the cocktails so I'd steer clear of those. Unless there is a can't miss type of comedian here, I can't ever picture going back to the Improv.

Perfect for a date night and I recommend going to a later show and grabbing dinner beforehand.  I received an online coupon code for $5 tickets for John Heffron. What a deal-def. check for deals before you pay full price for any shows here.  We went early to pick up the tickets at the ticket office.  People were lined up outside about an hour before the show and it was freezing out.  I had no interest in doing this so we grabbed a beer across the street at Rock Bottom. Once they opened the doors (15 minutes before show time) the line went quickly and even though we were at the end we still got seated at a table in the back.  It is not huge inside so there aren't really any bad seats.  They usually have an MC for the night who starts  warming up the crowd. This guy was funny and so was the opening act before John Heffron.  My only complaint about this place is that they have a two drink minimum and the prices are outrageous.  $9.50 for a mixed well drink and $7 for draft beers.  The soda was $3.50! Yikes!

That is funny because as I was telling people about going it became clear there are A LOT of people that haven't... Oh Well... Let me mention this was my first time there.

So I was warned in advance of the possible long waits outside and the two item minimum.  Well to my pleasant surprise there was no wait, walked right in, greeted, an usher showed us to our seats and we waited less than 5 minutes to be asked for our order.  This was nice.  I will say that the show started at 8pm, and we were there by 7:20 or so.  There were already people seated so we were by no means very early, and heck there were people with full course meals and tables of 10.  The price of the mixed drinks were not disclosed on the menu, leading me to believe that it may leave me short for the mortgage next month, but they did have a 60 minute dogfish head IPA for $6.00.  Now that may seem rather expensive and it is, but doable so I indeed did it... My husband got a domestic and it was between 4-5 bucks.  We opted not to eat there, as we were going to Rock Bottom after wards and I will get to that review later...

So the show was good.  There were moments that I think the comedians may have went off track and were just bantering, but luckily enough they rebound and got back to making everyone laugh instead of being uncomfortable.  There were a total of 4 comedians, the MC, and two opening acts for Crawford.  I actually really enjoyed them.  

The one or two things I didn't like about the place.  The bathrooms are in the lobby.  As this seems normal there is no separate area to enter back into the room without having to make your way through people who are waiting to be seated... This was/is stupid.  I was actually nervous that they were going to stop me and ask for my ticket which they safely secured at my first entrance.  The same also goes for smoking.  Since we were so early I took a break and it was again awkward reentering.  Maybe they need to have some type of system to get around this.  A stamped hand?  A ticket stub?  Not sure but I know I would have felt better unlike feeling like I was sneaking into the place.

I should have gotten on here and read the reviews before making that decision. We had what seems to be a typical experience at the improv. We were handed a paper menu with 4 items on it when we walked in the door. There was no other menu at the table and our waitress didn't offer us one either. She wanted our order, but as we were looking around the place, we realized that most of those around us were eating items that not on the menu provided to us. When asked about another menu, our waitress told us if we give her our drink order, she'll see what she can do. The table next to us handed over their menus so we had something to work with. Our drinks came, we finally put our orders in...and that was the last time we saw our waitress for almost a full 30 minutes. When she finally came back, all she wanted was to know if we wanted a 2nd round of drinks. After 30 minutes I was finally going to get a second beer! ""What about our food?"", we asked. ""Oh"", was her answer. Now, according to the menu, dinner came with a side salad, a complimentary glass of champagne, and a chocolate mousse dessert. That's all good and fine. After a couple of minutes, someone, not our waitress, finally brought out our meals. When we asked him about our salads, his reply was ""do you want me to take your food back?"". Really?!?! ""Do you want me to take your food back?"" After almost 45 minutes at this point, we had received 1 round of drinks and had seen our waitress only twice and had just received our food. No, I don't want you to take our food back! Halfway through eating our meals, which were by this time cold, our waitress finally came back with our second beers. She asked us how everything was. We asked about our salads. She said she was told we didn't want them. REALLY?!?! Is this a joke? Is it somehow part of the comedy routine that was going on? Sadly, no. The service didn't get any better. The food was lousy. Thankfully the standup was great. Lisa, Lisa and Matt all put on a hilarious show. Will I ever go back? Don't know. It took us an hour and a half to drive the 16 miles to get there, thanks to traffic. I do know that if we do it again, we will leave the house much earlier and eat somewhere else. The two drink minimum works at the improv because you will not get your waitress to your table more than that to order more drinks. In case you're interested, I am a chef who has been in the service industry for more than 30 years and worked every position possible in restaurants and bars. So, yes, I do have a preconceived notion as to how service and food should be. Even on Valentine's Day.",0,tv8cS4aaA1VDaInYgggb6g,0,1,2014-02-15,review,0
ckLyJAIbb4Do-ymu8fwMQQ,dQGgmV1tl31l2eRVphz4-A,"My husband and I love going to comedy shows and have seen some pretty good acts at the Improv. Ticket prices aren't bad either. I am very particular about where I sit, and the person who seats you is willing to let you sit where you choose, especially if it's on a Thursday or Sunday night, since those aren't particularly busy nights.

I did have one bad experience, which is why I'm giving this review 3 stars instead of 4 (it only takes one poor experience, people!). My husband and I went to see one of our favorite comedians on a Thursday night. There is a two-item minimum, so we decided we would just eat dinner at the show. Well, we were mistaken. First of all, our waitress was rude and slow. After sitting there for 5 or 6 minutes without service she finally comes over and asks what we want. We both order a drink and food, to which she tells us that the kitchen caught on fire earlier that day so all they have are salads and desserts. I was annoyed that she even asked what we wanted instead of starting out with this important fact.

At any rate, I order a Caesar salad and a beer. It comes out and it's iceburg lettuce with shredded cheese, tomatoes, and other veggies. In other words, a regular salad. I inform the waitress of this and she seemed totally confused. I suppose she did not understand the difference, which was odd. 

Overall, I felt that there was no apology for the fact we couldn't eat, let alone everyone else in the place. Salad or dessert aren't the greatest choices when you are expecting to eat dinner at the show. I think the Improv should have waived the two-item minimum on this occasions, even if it cost them money. 

Afterwards, I emailed the Improv with my concerns. Never. Heard. Back.

That being said, I will most likely return to the Improv....but not for the service. Because it's a great place to see comedy shows and isn't that expensive. Customer service is terrible.",0,tv8cS4aaA1VDaInYgggb6g,0,3,2014-03-01,review,3

Vj4O2UfLm8PkGudiije0cw,iHrJAp0VUx_e75z0mMZ--g,"If The Improv chain didn't bring in such amazing comedians, this place would be totally screwed. 

I always have fun watching the comedians, but I can't help but leave with such a bitter taste in my mouth from how much of a rip off this place is.

First you buy the tickets, but if you buy online you have an outrageous service charge. The real kicker is having to buy a minimum of 2 items during the show, beers are $5 or $6 and the cheapest things on the menu, I believe. Cocktails are $11-$13. I think glasses of wine are around $8. There is a pretty good selection of food options. 

The improv does have a lot of great comedians who pass through! Even the opening acts are generally great! Line up early if you want a great seat right in the front! 

The point is, a night at the Improv will be fun, but if you aren't prepared for it, it can end up being a pretty unexpectedly and unreasonably expensive affair.",0,tv8cS4aaA1VDaInYgggb6g,1,3,2014-09-08,review,1

jThUkO26of_9arLY5zUszg,wDh0Wek1e9v5apk4ZZ6MWA,"Absolutely loved it at the Improv! I saw Sheryl Underwood and she was fantastic. It was my first time being at the Improv. After years of saying that I wanted to go, it really did meet my expectations! The ambiance is inviting, with warm lighting and a good amount of seating for a smaller place. We were 8th in line so we had good choice of seating, though we were encouraged to fill the seats in the front by the stage first. The seating is layered in tiers. Each tier has a long booth with tables and chairs for seating. It was very comfortable, roomy and an interactive set up. The stage is close to the seating (some tables are right at the stage) with little space between you and the comedian, which made it very interactive and fun. We arrived at the Improv around 9:45 pm for a show that started at 10:30 pm, with doors opening at 10:00 pm. We waited in line until the doors opened at about 10:15-10:20 pm, so they were really behind schedule. The show started around 10:45 pm with two opening comedians before the main act. The show was over around 1:00 am. The only negatives were that the staff was not very friendly and immediately told me that I have to buy a minimum of two items off of the menu. ($30/ticket isn't enough?) I was not hungry and did not want to drink, so this was a bit frustrating, especially because it wasn't disclosed on the ticket or anywhere else. The server did not hold us to the 2 minimum purchase requirement and my friend and I got away getting 3 drinks for the night. The food menu looked great and the prices seemed reasonable, though if you want water you are looking at $5 for Fiji or sparkling. It was $8 for a glass of wine. $11 for bottomless soda, complete with a take home Improv glass. The other thing that I didn't like was that an employee takes your tickets while you're waiting in line and marks your hands with a dry erase marker. After one bathroom trip, the mark was gone, so I think they need a more effective way to mark you as an already paid customer since the employee takes your proof of purchase. These negatives did not affect my overall experience negatively and I would most certainly go back!

We dropped $40 on a chicken quesadilla, 6 hot wings, and 2 Yuengling drafts. The whole time I just sit there thinking about all the amazing places I COULD have eaten for $40. Burgatory is right down the street. Hell, TGI Friday's would have been better.

Well, a line had formed outside because they hadn't opened the doors.  That is all well and good if it is summertime but it was 4 degrees.  People stood out there upwards of 20 minutes, freezing.  They didn't let people in because they claimed the room was not ready.  Seating is first come, first served.  Whoever designed this place should be shot.  There is no lobby to hold people before a show.  The Improv in Cleveland is superb.  That location has a huge lobby and bar where you can mingle before the show and they have ushers seat you.  The Pittsburgh Improv is a disaster layout-wise.  Beverage service was fine.  It got really, really warm in the room and even the comedian was sweating like a freak show.

The only downfall is the two drink minimum, which I understand, but their prices make it ridiculous. We stuck to beer because we knew it wouldn't be watered down. Our waitress was horrible. We did not have an opportunity to order our second drinks until the other waitresses were bringing out checks. If our waitress was more attentive, the club could have made more money off of us. Oh well. 

I would recommend eating at a restaurant before the show because the food menu is limited and overpriced. 

The only other thing I'm not a fan of is the seating. We were fortunate enough to get there early and have the back of a booth. The last few people who arrived got the turned around seats in front of us. I feel that the club should invest in long, thin tables like bars have so everyone has a surface to put their food or drinks.

Negatives: Drink prices are high, and food quality in respect to the price is disproportional.  Entertainer-wise, there is a local comic who opens up for many of the main attractions.  I have seen him open up no less than four times over a span of 3 years, and his act is exactly the same every time.  I have it almost memorized.

Continue doing the things you do well, and try to improve the things that almost everyone on Yelp complains about, and you'll be looking at 5 stars from most.  No one wants to come to the Improv to get ""Straint Up"" (see what I did there, Improv?)",0,tv8cS4aaA1VDaInYgggb6g,0,3,2015-10-09,review,0

I was involved in bringing all the big name comedy acts to Ohio State as a student and I have to say I was really surprised at how good Ian's improv was. So there's no complaint here. 

Quality of Groupon's value = 1 star. So I still had to pay for tickets. Yep at $20 for 2 people. Not bad but the 2 item minimum is zero bang for your buck. The menu online is incorrect and the actual prices are EVEN higher than a $8 slice of frozen cake and $11 for a plate of 8 chicken nuggets. Holy moly, it's like cheap pub food at high end bistro price. Then you have to tip on top of that $50 bill (PLUS the $20 for tickets!) for two people and a crappy meal? Wow. I get that the place is trying to gouge money out of you for a good show. Well...try this--charge $25 per person for the tickets and have the menu be optional. This way, you can guarantee high ticket sales but also get the people who will drink and eat there regardless. 

Portions are reasonable, I suppose. I got the BLT meal and chocolate chip cheesecake. Left me very full but you best believe the only reason I ate there was because I needed to hit that 2-item min. Seating was pretty cramped because you'll have to sit with strangers. 

I went to the 7pm show which was great because you can be seated early and just eat while you wait for the show to start. I saw this longass line when I left that I assumed to be the 9:30pm show with everyone waiting outside in the cold. Seems like a crappy setup for the later show! Service was haphazard. Some of the waitresses seemed pretty attentive and quick but mine was particularly slow. He wasn't rude but twice I had to ask the other waitress for sauce and a water refill. We got up to get napkins ourselves. I would wave to catch his attention and he would hurry off the opposite direction. Ugh. 

Please, Groupon, there needs to be reform on this pricing structure. Come out with a new deal of paying full price for the tickets and then waiving the 2-item minimum!",0,tv8cS4aaA1VDaInYgggb6g,0,3,2016-02-29,review,1

1. Prices are outrageous. If you walk 100 yards over to the Target next to it, you'll find some of the same items for 30-40% cheaper. A bag of Gevalia coffee is $7.99 at GE, the same coffee at Target is $4.99. And it's not just coffee, and not just Target. Giant Eagle has little other grocer competition in Pittsburgh. This being the case, if you're not near an Aldi's, Target or Walmart, you have to go to GE for stuff. They're banking on this lack of competition. 

2. Parking lots are thrashed every day, all the time. Now, maybe you don't care. But when I go in the morning, they've been open maybe 30 minutes and there are shopping carts littering the parking lot and the sidewalk in front of the building. They clearly don't bring them in at the end of the night. They also rarely have any small baskets near the door, you'll need to hunt for one. It's just laziness and a lack of care, on both accounts. They don't care about the appearance of the outside, nor the convenience for the customers. 

3. I don't normally mind the self-checkout, but only if I have a limited number of items. If I need a full grocery order, I'm going to have to wait in line for one of the two cashiers working the registers, on a Saturday. The lack of customer service in this regard is atrocious. I'm already paying exorbitant prices, but I also have to ring up and bag my cart full of groceries too? Walmart doesn't even make you do that!

So that's about it. If you don't mind paying much higher than average grocery prices, ringing and bagging your cart full of groceries and generally being an afterthought as a customer, than Giant Eagle in Waterfront is awesome!",0,eT5Ck7Gg1dBJobca9VFovw,0,2,2013-05-14,review,0
RP4kX4YZDvakqSF25tiuEA,5uZ8_StpG-E7ck9kIiOuwA,"This review is specifically for the DFS cleaners at this Giant Eagle location.  I dropped clothing off for the sake of convenience once (I really should have known better).  Never again.  My items came back completely covered in lint.  I could let this slide, however my pencil skirt was safety pinned to the hanger.  The weight of the skirt caused even larger holes than what were placed there by the pins.  Being that it's a pencil skirt designed to have a blouse tucked in, there's no way that I can wear it again.  This was an expensive skirt, completely ruined.  Very disappointed.  Again, this review is just for the dry cleaners.  The rest of the store is actually better than a lot of other GE's I've been to in Pittsburgh.  Just don't take your dry cleaning here.",0,eT5Ck7Gg1dBJobca9VFovw,0,1,2013-08-19,review,0
9OZH1Ecw-qUkCW5MS0NefA,85g9TH1xo2-Sw5GJhvlB3g,"I've stopped by here a few times (most recently tonight) to pick up random groceries.  This store is located next to one of the bike trails that I frequent, hence its convenience despite being fairly far from my apt.

On the positive side, I appreciate the size of this store and the selection of products.  In terms of size, it's larger than the Shadyside Market District (my normal grocery store, hence my standard of comparison), and I'd say the product selection is very similar.  Unlike the MD, when I've visited, the aisles have seemed fairly empty of customers, which may be due to the times of my visits (usually between 7-8pm), as well as the size of the store.  Because it's not a Market District, the prices are a bit less expensive, which is nice.

On the negative side, the checkout always seems to take forever due to slow customers and/or employees, despite that I've only purchased a couple of items at a time.  The ""express"" lanes move at the speed of molasses, and the self-checkouts are even worse.  Speaking of which, this store has *way* too many self-checkout lanes (about a third of the lanes), and the non-express ones with the belts are unintuitive.

Prior to tonight, I would have awarded this store a rating of 4 or perhaps even 4.5.  However, checkout tonight was even more of a PITA than it usually is.  None of the normal express checkout lanes were staffed with cashiers, despite that I saw at least one employee loafing around talking to another.  So, I was forced to use one of the many self-checkout lanes.  Normally, I don't mind this, esp. when I'm only purchasing a couple of items, but the empty self-checkout lane that I spotted was one with a conveyor belt, and I couldn't figure out how to use it (not that it mattered, since I had only one item, but the self-checkout lanes must be operated using a very specific procedure--see below).  So, I moved over to one of the express self checkout lanes (similar to those in the Shadyside MD), which I knew how to operate.  However, I still managed to bungle the process since I forgot to scan my one item *before* I put it on the scale that doubles as a bagging station, so I had to wait for one of the ever-so-slow employees to come over and key in an authorization code so I could pay.

I'm not sure if the self-checkout stands that GE uses are standard in the industry, since I've never used them anywhere else, but I *hate* the whole weighing/bagging process.  In order to use the self-checkout stations, each item must be scanned and then placed on the scale, and if the weight isn't correct for any reason (including using your own bag), an employee is summoned to check it.  I assume the intention is to prevent people from shoplifting, but (1) it's a major PITA for both customers and employees; (2) most of the employees (including the one I dealt with tonight) don't care, and just key the code without even looking at the error message explaining why they were summoned; and (3) I doubt most shoplifters pay for any of the items they're pilfering--they most likely just stuff them into their purse, clothes, etc. and walk out!  /rant

The first time they misread a prescription and gave me the wrong dose of Synthroid, about 1/10th of what I needed. I ended up so sick after 2 weeks of taking too little that I was half dead before the problem was caught. Their response when I told them was to say ""oops"" and ""it won't happen again"". Not even a sorry, and it never did happen again b/c I went to Costco after that. This latest time was classic. I came with a simple scrip. Costco was closed so I went to Giant Eagle. After 45 minutes the finally inform me that they can't fill it b/c the scrip isn't specific enough (it was for a common antibiotic, nothing complicated). They didn't bother to call me earlier or tell me sooner, just made me wait and wait and wait until I pitched a fit to tell me that they couldn't fill it. It was late and I went to Rite Aid in Sq. Hill with the same exact scrip and they had ZERO issues filling it quickly. WTF? How can it be easy peasy at Rite Aid but Giant Eagle can't even muster the effort to tell me that they are too incompetent to fill it out? I wonder if there is even a legit pharmacist working there at all. It seems like they aren't even staffing the pharmacy with trained techs, just random people off of the street.

They sell beer, they have a cute little cafe sitting area, they sell ""meals for 2"" in their prepared foods section, produce always seems great, cashiers are friendly ect. The location seems pretty large. I also like how there are 2 entrances (one at pharmacy.) The parking lot is pretty large so it helps having another entrance for cold or rainy days. I am at this location alot more than the southside GE since my gym is in the waterfront. It makes it easier to get everything done in one plaza.

I went here after a dinner date with some neighbors and couldn't believe how packed it was. We had to wait 10 minutes just to find enough chairs to seat 4 people. We ended up stealing them from other tables. Not to mention my hubby stood in line for 15 minutes just to get an Ice tea lemonade.

So amidst all the books, newspapers and magazines they have an audio and video section. The prices aren't anything to rave about. I can buy the same movies online for a lot cheaper there's just the waiting period. I do shop here sometimes for there discount books. I found a lot of great recipe and mystery books for really cheap, like under $5. That's a pretty good deal but considering there is a half priced book store who has a great selection of books for literally half the price of retailers, how can you beat those prices. 

B&N is more of a hangout spot with books in case you want to buy one right there and then. But everything is kind of confusing you always need to ask where something is.

You know, the kind where there is a short story (2 or 3 pages) with some type of problem or 'who-done-it' to solve at the end. My bestie and I go to the pool a lot in the summer and I thought it would be something fun to sit and read while we were lounging out. I used to read them all of the time when I was younger and thought it would be something different. And yes, I know I could check online but, hey, I was already here.

Any-who....I go in and easily find the ""customer service"" area, which is located in the middle of the store. It is a round kiosk. One woman is being waited on by an employee. There are 5 other employees standing behind the kiosk, talking among themselves. One of the workers notices me and comes over to help. I tell him what I'm searching for and he quickly looks it up on the computer. He takes me to an area of puzzles, but they are crosswords, sudokus, coloring books, etc. I tell him these aren't what I'm looking for. He said he might have something where the magazines are. He goes off to check while I look around. He comes back with some magazines, but it still isn't what I'm interested in. (sorry c dub). I thank him and continue to browse on my own. 

Pros: the place is clean and well organized. Areas are pretty well marked by genre, discount books, cards, etc. The guy who assisted me was friendly and tried to be as helpful as possible.

Incidentally, ""The Hangover"" is one of the funniest movies I've seen in years and worth the $10 to see it in the theater.  Okay, back to the restaurant the space itself is very nice.  There are plenty of hightops, plasmas and a few booths.  It's spacious and they have outdoor seating and open windows.  We sat at the bar and were greeted relatively quickly by the bartender who was tending a pretty much empty bar.  I ordered a guinness as usual, Rob ordered a long island iced tea and Matt had a miller light.  Make sure and tell them if you want a top shelf tea else you'll be getting the stuff in the plastic bottles.  I sampled Rob's long island tea and it was not that good way too much sours.  The next one he ordered was much better after a little guidance to the bartender.  The bartender herself was okay, not too friendly but quick enough with the pours.  I don't remember her name which is usually not a good sign.  We ordered a few things from the appetizer menu.  We started with the chips and salsa.  The chips were crisp enough, but not served warm and the salsa had some spice but the colors were a little off kind of looked like the color of pea soup.  Rob then ordered the philly cheese steak sliders.  I tried one it was okay I guess  the bun was warm and it was pretty loaded with cheese and onions.  He asked for a side of mayo and they said they were out, which is bizarre because there is a giant eagle a couple blocks away.  This pretty much sums up my experiences at the Bar Louie's I've been too.  They kind of do just enough for me to come back but rarely make any real effort with service.  Maybe I'm being too critical... I tried to order the baked goat cheese, but they were out... So, I settled on the hummus appetizer.  This was surprisingly pretty good.  The pita was warm and toasted the hummus had lots of flavor and the tabouleh was edible.  It's probably best to stick to simple stuff when dining here.  Matt had the hot wings which I tried one and it was okay, your pretty standard mass produced chicken wing.  All in all this place isn't that bad.

However, we were bothered that none of the special martinis actually resembled a real martini. No gin or vermouth was used, it's mostly purees and champagne floats with flavored vodkas.

Anyway, the small plates made for good ""upscale"" bar food. Half-price apps make for a cheap, but nice, dinner and a movie - great, great specials. However, I would not buy a full-priced dinner here. Nothing aside from the apps grabbed me for the outstanding price. The baked goat cheese was small but delicious, and the tempura fried shrimp was just right but the sauces didn't match up exactly.

The place was near empty and there were three waitresses. Got seated and waited on immediately. Ordered drinks, and it took them 15 minutes to come...no, not alcoholic drinks, two waters and an iced tea. This should have been a bad sign, but at this point we ordered food.

20 minutes go by...we flag down our waitress, to let her know that we need to get to a movie in 45 minutes. She said our food would be out in a few minutes. Another 20 minutes, still no food, and our waitress is nowhere to be seen. We flag down another waitress, she says she will find our waitress, who we then notice is chatting with one of the other waitresses. She finishes her conversation and finally makes her way over to our table about five minutes later. She says she didn't even realize our food hadn't arrived (well, you never even checked on us, so of course you didn't). After speaking with the kitchen staff, she informs us that she ""definitely"" put our order in so it ""must have been given to someone else by mistake."" Because they wouldn't have noticed that that WASN'T what they ordered? Seriously?

The waitress told us she could give us our food for take out and, since we were starving, we reluctantly agreed. 10 minutes later, our food and the bill arrived. All that was comped was the iced tea, and we got some free utensils and wetnaps. How generous! We shovelled what we could into our mouths, did NOT leave a tip (thankfully, we didn't have the added gratuity that John had), and sprinted to our movie where we covertly finished our smuggled food. Worst part? I opened the wetnap, and it was totally dry. Of course.

However, I gave this place two stars instead of one. That's because my food, when I finally got it, was perfect. I had the Greek burger and it was huge, cooked exactly how I like it, with delicious toppings.

Remember when you'd go somewhere and have good food, great service and a general pleasant experience and then a few months you'd go back and have it all again? Well one day you decide to go back and you realized everything has changed in a way that you can't describe and the place is no longer familiar. To me, that is Bar Louie

I can't say the food is bad. I had an order of the pretzel sticks for an appetizer and the cinnamon sauce tasted like water and the pretzels were stale. I will say I still ate them so shame on me. My  sandwich (the Mario) as always was very good.

Now here comes the bad:

1. There were fruit flies EVERYWHERE. I felt like we were eating on top of a garbage dump. At one point I had to get a new drink because one flew in my beer. I understand that the establishment is an indoor/outdoor place but there is no reason for 15 fruit flies to hover over my table.

2. The place is enormous and they had one, very nice, but over worked server. The girl looked like she was about to have a heart attack because she never stopped moving.

3. Because of number two our service in general was not good. I can't totally blame the girl she did the best we could. I mean. I've played Diner Dash on my iPad, I know what happens when a place fills up too quickly when you are the only one working.

It's sad when a place you love turns into a place you never want to go again. I think I'm being very generous by giving it two stars but because I used to love it so much I can't rate it that low.

This is probably the first place I've been to where they charge $10 and up for all mixed drinks. To me, that is beyond ridiculous. Bar Louie is not an upscale restaurant, as much as they wish they were, and paying almost $60 for three drinks and two appetizers is insanity defined.

I ordered a Strawberry Peach Bellini and a S'Mores Martini, and both were tasty. We shared Bruschetta Pomodoro, Spinach & Artichoke Dip, and Roasted Vegetable Flatbread. The food was also good, and I would order all three items again in the future.

They had two bartenders on (I think) and not nearly enough cocktail servers.  The server apologized for the wait on the drinks, but explained it away with ""this happens at the end of happy hour because the bar get swamped"".  That is a sign that you need more staff.  I have never had this happen at any other bar before.  Get more staff.  We ended up passing up on food because we were worried about time, not the fact that we did not get HH pricing.  Even though, in my opinion, they should have honored HH pricing since we were ready to order food at 7:50/7:55.  We ended up going to the Improv and got food there.

The food has been decent - a few years back I splurged on an enormous fried chicken sandwich and definitely enjoyed it, glutton that I am - but their meals and appetizers alike have admittedly never ""wowed"" me. And while I enjoy their cocktails and would consider stopping in just for drinks more often, the problem is that things are way overpriced here. Even during the happy hour drinks are pretty costly, not to mention that I think most of the drinks I personally like don't qualify for the happy hour discount, which is disappointing. Once I stopped in with friends after a movie and one drink cost me $10 here. Not even a large one, either! Sorry, but I find that to be kind of ridiculous, especially since there's cheaper places to get drinks in the area.

Still, the food and drinks are definitely a-ok albeit overpriced, so this place would be rated 3 stars in my mind IF I could hear myself think when I eat here. But good Lord, they're just so loud! I always leave with a sore throat from yelling to make myself heard. Not cool, Bar Louie. Not cool.

So while the food and drinks are fine enough the loud venue and prices mean that this is definitely not one of my favorite places - and given the other options we have at the Waterfront I don't expect to be back in any time soon.",1,EoAY1JSVeJriBzId8lUQwQ,0,2,2014-10-11,review,0

Then you can add toppings to complete your burger at a small cost-cheese 75 cents, veggies 50 cents, Artery Cloggers 75 cents, sauce 25 cents. Those are the headings and they have items listed under them-like 9 different cheeses. You can also get a basket of tots or fries for a small price as well. 
My burger was $2.25 after I added toppings. Is it the best burger I've ever had? No. But is it the best $2.25 burger I've ever had?  Yes. It's kind if a Russian roulette as to how your burger will come to you cooked. Mine was well done and one if my son's burger had pink in the middle.

Everything was delicious, the decor was industrial chic (which I love) and the atmosphere was buzzing and fun. The menu was a tad exotic for my small-town pallet, but it was great.

My boyfriend ordered the chicken and bleu cheese flatbread, and I really liked it. I'd suggest ordering that if you come here for a bite to eat. I also tried their Pinot Grigio, but it was in a very dirty glass.

Service was ok as well. It wasn't really busy, but it was steady. When we walked in no one was around the door and there were dirty tables everywhere. So we made our way towards the back and sat down at the only clean table. It seems like the waitresses won't clean the tables until after new customers sit down. After a few minutes, I noticed a table of two that were beside us. They were there before us but they had yet to be taken care of even after we got our drinks and ordered.

Especially nice in the summertime when the garage doors come up, windows open and upper loft patio is full.  Flame pits are on the patio and provide warmth on a cool night.
The food is an eclectic mix.  Burgers are great as are the tots, get them loaded or better yet down them for speed :). Mussels are good, salads are great!  Appetizers are all excellent.  Try the Bavarian pretzels with quest or the calamari!  My favorite, especially on a cold or rainy day is their chicken tortilla soup.  If you give a green light to the cook, he'll spice it up to en fuego,  the way it's meant to be eaten. 
Endless refills of soft drinks allow you to sit and chat for as long as you like.  This is a wonderful spot to people watch on movie night or catch some of the Steelers who like to stop by.

Okay... Kudos, for letting us know in advance.

But my Chicago friend Catherine came in to visit for the weekend and after a day at the zoo, we donned our swimsuits and came here.  The main part of the park is closed in the evenings, but the Sandbar and the Sandbar Pool and the Hot Tub remain open for the 21 and over set.  The Sandbar has a great menu of food and drinks and has a $6.00 cover charge to get in.  Occasionally there's live entertainment.

It's hard to believe that before they built this place, it was the site of an abandoned steel mill.  Actually, it was the railroad yard for the nearby Homestead Works.  But after site-clearing and clean-up, they turned it into a beautiful place to spend a warm day or nice evening.  The view across the Mon is quite beautiful with a wooded hillside on the other side.  There's even a boat dock, so you can arrive by river if you desire.

The waterpark is nice and lounging by the pool or floating around the lazy river is perfect for a hot summer day. There are just too many misses in my book though.

1st off all Traffic is a biatch! Be ready to sit on browns hill rd for a very long time unless you leave before 9am and wait for the park to open at 10am. 

Next remember it is a family park so there will be lots of rude and bratty kids all over the place. (I'm not a mean kid hater) my experiences have been bad at the Sandbar pool. 

If you do arrive early enough you will be standing in the hot sun with a gang of kids that WILL push you out of the way and run to claim 10 chairs with towels even though they won't use them because they run around the park all day. I actually got into an argument last summer with one said kid. I was like ""I'm an adult and you need to have some respect."" He pushed me and took all the chairs. I only needed one and his mother did not correct him. I was on fire and moved a chair over from the back and he still was giving me crap because I moved the chairs over...THAT NO ONE was even there to sit in at the time. Damn! FOR REAL!

Sandbar drinks are expensive and incredibly weak. Plus they are so sugary. If you do get a frozen drink and sit by the pool be prepared for it to be half pool water in a few minutes. An Adult area would change all this. I don't even care that I'm getting splashed all the time I do realize that I'm at a pool but it's hard to relax.

If you do get a pass have a friend who can get there the same days you can go. If you're trying to go on the weekend forget it! The weekdays are bad enough. I'm looking for a better pool side lounge for this summer.",1,uI0LvTXFACid1308KFO5ew,2,2,2011-03-14,review,2

If you're going, it's best to stop by Giant Eagle and grab you some discount tickets from the customer service desk.  $25 is still a bit much in my opinion, but it's better than spending the full $30.99.

There isn't much I can think of that's in Sandcastle that isn't a great time, except maybe walking around and scorching your feet on the boardwalk.  I personally am a huge fan of some of the faster tube slides, and of course the massive speed slide.  If you're looking for a more relaxed ride, check out the Lazy River, or screw around in the big pool.  There's also a pretty nice wave pool there for your amusement.

There's also plenty of stuff for kids to do... But I don't have kids, so I don't know how all that is.

They do close at 7PM, which is a bit early, so be warned: you definitely want to show up earlier in the day.

On the one hand, there are plenty of waterslides/pools that are a good fit for young ""riders"", on the other hand, Sandcastle, like any city amusement park, attracts more than its fair share of highschool kids looking to spend some time away from their parents and assert their personhood.  

Unfortunately that element doesn't particularly care about ""censoring"" speech for 9 year old ears, and worse, in the Mon Tsunami, about personal space, since the wave pool becomes a near mosh pit of jostling and strutting and shoving and 'showing off' for the fairer sex, and that can be a little dicey for the littler kids.

Having said that, it's still a good day at the park. . . cheese fries, a cool dip in the pool on a hot day, some fun slides. . . 

I think in rating Sandcastle fairly you have to understand the context of the park.  It is NOT policed particularly effectively.  if you take small children you have to be a diligent parent and be aware of your surroundings, paying attention to the group of 17 somethings thrashing around in your near vicinity, ""accidentally"" bumping into people for a reaction from their group.

Anyway, it was in California at Raging Rivers and it was a traumatizing experience. Screaming & being tossed around in the pool that pushes periodic waves at the sound of a loud horn and ending up with scraped knees and feet. Not fun.

So to say the least, I was a bit nervous coming to this water park afraid to have another episode of feeling I was being drowned. Luckily that did not happen.

I seriously had SO MUCH fun here! I honestly was only expecting to go on the Lazy River pool all day but with my bf, we hit up so many rides... tandem AND single rides! I feel like such a big girl now! Definitely lean back while you're on those single donuts on the water rides, or else you feel like you're going to flip over while swishing down the tubes. The new dragon ride they just opened up was okay. I was expecting it to be so much more fun, but literally you just slide down a dark tube into a circular room where you just slowly swirl your way down the middle hole and that was it. 

There was this one ride where you slide down the tubes for a few seconds, then you land into a pool where a worker pushes you into another tube and this continues about 3 times. It was weird. Kinda awkward with the worker having to grab you and push you through. Although it was still fun. The last dude threw me in backwards! Scared the crap out of me but it was fun :)

The food here is surprisingly pretty affordable. Plus, who wants to eat a huge meal while in your swim suit. Me don't want no pot belly. 

Overall I had such a fun time here. It definitely made me rethink my fear of water parks. By the way, we went on a Saturday in early June and it wasn't as packed as I thought it would be! So the lines weren't long at all. Also, go to Giant Eagle to purchase your discounted tickets. You save a few bucks versus buying them at the water park.

Let's do the compliment sandwich.  Positive - negative - positive!  

The negative... I feel like Sandcastle is the forgotten redheaded stepchild of Kennywood.  They keep pouring money into K-wood, but Sandcastle stays the same year after year.  Now, granted I haven't been there in YEARS, but everything seemed the same as I left it other than one new slide.  I haven't been there in about 9 years.  One new slide in 9 years?  Hmmmmm....

I see major places to improve.  Especially the pool.  I honestly think the slides are great, although you could always add more, they're still fun.  The pool... it's just packed.  So packed that you'd think they'd add a second pool.  Looking around it looks like they have the extra space.  Maybe an adults only pool?  Swimming with 20 zillion kids, plus adults drinking (yes I like that you can bring your bevvie in the pool... but it's kinda weird being around so many kids) and you start to wonder how clean the water is.  I mean, 20 zillion kids you gotta expect a good amount of kiddos are peeing in the pool!  

The sidewalks are also scalding hot.  I'd assume since many of the people are walking around barefoot you'd be able to custom order some kind of non sun absorbing surface.  And I""m NOT investing in those dorky water shoes, sorry!  

I'm ALWAYS happy to see a Potato Patch stand!  Just as good as K-wood!  They also serve chicken tender, which is nice if you want a little meat to add on.  Nothing more is needed for me!  Although the frozen drinks looked tasty and tempting, it was so hot out I was just downing water by the gallons.  You're also allowed to bring in your own snacks and food, which I think is nice for families who want to save a little mola.  

Again, Sandcastle is so awesome to have in the Burgh, it would be nice to see improvements.  It always seems packed in the summer months, so why not keep on improving it?  Or maybe they think don't fix what's not broken.  I just may stick to a cleaner, less pee filled community pool for my water fun fix!",2,uI0LvTXFACid1308KFO5ew,4,3,2012-07-16,review,5

First, let me say that I'm reviewing the waterpark, not the people. The park has little to no control over the people that visit the park and the way they or their children behave. 

If you are going to visit, I would HIGHLY suggest you try to go on a weekday. I've attempted to visit on nice weekends before when the park has actually been at capacity and they are no longer allowing people in. It gets CROWDED on the weekends, especially if the weather is nice. There aren't a ton of nice days in the summer in Pittsburgh, so when there are nice days, people come out in droves! 

The slides are a blast, the lines are sometimes very long, but worth it. The lazy river is great when it's not wall to wall people. I really enjoy the new Dragon's Den but the line is CRAZY long for it! They also have a fantastic bar area, we have gone a few times and enjoyed a festive beverage while we enjoy the sun!

They have several areas for smaller children, which are all fantastic. 

If you are visiting, trying to take advantage of the giant eagle discount tickets, because these can get really pricey. You can also do a Sandcastle/Kennywood ticket, where you visit Sandcastle during the day and Kennywood at night.

i planned ahead a day to go for me & bobby (his first time) it was supposed to be nice day, but the weather changed in 2 weeks.. 

we picked a nice time.. since it was literally supposed to rain all day, there werent any long lines/ we literally rode every water slide in one hour. then we went to head to the lazy river--- & it was closed! they said it was closed due to not enough attendence, but i mean come on. we still paid $70 for 2 people to come in this park where i just rode everything in one hour.. keep the lazy river open so i can kill an hour! aah. the cliff hanger was also closed- like always. 

so we just went and rode everything again. the Dragon's Den is sweet and the blue tubaluba is as well. bobby had a blast on the speed slides. i have to admit though, i do miss the regular body slide. 

another reason i chose august 3rd to go to sandcastle was that the park was open until 7pm rather than 5 or 6 like regular days. well actually at 4:45 we recieved a ""15 minute warning"" that the park was closing at 5 due to rain. ugh, a little more time would've been helpful. 

i couldnt hear the warning and asked an employee who said they were closing in ten minutes due to the weather and being under-staffed to stay open until 7. it started to rain at 5 and literally at 5:20 the rain was over . the park could've just shut down the rides until the rain cloud passed,  but due to being under-staffed would rather hand out rain checks.. which is fine because we get an another entire day, but i mean it would be a terrible inconvience from someone out of town who planned a family day. 

overall, the smile on my boyfriend's face was priceless, but i truly wish we could've enjoyed the lazy river and the park until 7. hopefully next time things go as planned....",1,uI0LvTXFACid1308KFO5ew,1,3,2013-08-05,review,1

I do know the prices have gone up but i can remember paying $19.  I think the best thing you can do is purchase the tickets at giant eagle or even looking on the sandcastle website for deals.  My sister for a deal for 19.99 and day in the 2015 season.  I  paid 26.99 at my local giant eagle.  Thats not really a big deal.  

I am definetly shocked that there was a $6 or $12 fee to park.. I mean its ridiculous we have to pay what we pay to get in and another fee to park is crazy.  We opted for the $12 fee to park real close to the entrance bc of having a 7 year old with us.  It is worth that extra $6.  

I learned that you should get there and line up at the game fairly early if you want a good spot by the pool... People with plow you over and run to get a prime spot.  That is a downfall.  Plus this means that there are a lot of RUDE PEOPLE.  We got there early enough to ride all the rides we needed too.  we didn't do the lay river however because the lines were RIDICULOUS.  

The wave pool was a hit for my son but just watch all the people there.  People are rude there as well.  Some horse play and such.

The other issue I had yesterday is there was a young lady in her late teens/early 20's who was wear a black bikini. The bottoms were a modified thing. (Modified meaning it was a smidge wider than a whale's tail thong.). It was NOT appropriate at all. My family was sitting in the wave pool area and saw the young lady multiple times. Two of those times there was a female leader/manager who was standing there. She watched the girl and made comments to the workers but never said anything to the girl. 
The Lifeguards are nice and do a good job. The employees at the food stations are also nice and service is quick. Our family is a big fan of Chic Fil A so we love it when they are there. The park just needs to tweak a few things to get 4 or 5 stars. Keeping restrooms clean and updating some of the chairs and loungers would be steps in the right direction.",3,uI0LvTXFACid1308KFO5ew,0,3,2016-07-05,review,2

ebkIDbi0u8Gxfnj8MWXtdQ,u6UwPlgwEG1Ns5KYJlyhKw,"My husband and I are season pass holders and try to make it out to the park once a week. I've been coming here for about 7 years now and not much has changed. Most of the time we just hang out at the wave pool or relax on the lazy river. The food is good but I wish they offered some healthier options. They have a salad but that's about it. I'm not a major crazy health nut but something non-fried would be nice. If your not too worried about the calories their food is delicious, a bit overpriced, but your at an amusement park so what do you expect. 

This year they have also been slacking on cleanliness. I've had to use the bathrooms a lot since I'm expecting and I wish they would send someone in more often throughout the day. 

One other reviewer mentioned an adult area. Sadly they don't have this, but I think it would be great!!!  I usually visit on the weekend since I work weekdays and having children bump into you and splash you everywhere you go isn't very relaxing. 

The staff is great. I have never seen a more attentive group of people. They are always on alert and I have no worries about the safety of the children in my family visiting with me when they can. I also plan on being my new baby next year and I have no fears about his well-being. 

Here are a few tips if you want to save $$$. Pack your lunch. See park rules on cooler sizes and don't pack any glass. On weekends/holidays get there when they open if you want good seats or a seat in the shade. If you plan on going more then twice buy a season pass, it will save you time and money. If you ever plan on bringing guests get a VIP pass for buddy tickets, parking pass and a souvenir cup. Souvenir cups are good if you like to drink something other then water they save you a ton on refills and you can use them all season long. Bring flip flops. The pavement gets scalding hot. I burnt the bottom of my feet the first time I was there this year. If you plan on coming late a lot bring your own folding lounge chair. After the opening rush on busy days they are all gone in the first hour. If you plan on having a group of 5 or more renting a cabana is really worth it, especially if you have older kids. It gives them a place to always find you. And finally buy your tickets ahead of time. It's always more expensive at the gate then online or at a local retailer. You can even buy your tickets online while standing I front of the gate. They can scan your ticket off your smart phone. 

Note to other guests... Please watch your children and don't rely on the lifeguards to babysit them. They are your responsibility. The lifeguards are there to keep them safe and alive but not respectful. Also please be courteous to others and only put your towels on chairs your using. I was late arriving last weekend (got there at noon) and sat next to 2 perfectly good lounge chairs with towels on them while I sat on the grass. For 6 hours I never noticed 1 person use them. 

I hope this helps!!",0,uI0LvTXFACid1308KFO5ew,0,4,2016-07-19,review,0

ABD Mattress quickly alleviated any idiotic fears I may have had. The store was empty when I arrived on a Monday afternoon and I was attended to immediately and never felt pressured. ABD has a great selection of mattresses, and the prices cannot be beat. I picked up a full plush pillow-top mattress for a cool $375 (without a box spring or a frame, since I already had one).

I had a lot of anxiousness about buying a mattress. If it's terrible, you'll be spending a large proportion of your life in misery until you fix the problem. Who wants that? Especially for something that can be as expensive as a mattress? 

These people were great. They patiently answered all of my mattress questions and treated me like a valued customer - both times I called, the man on the phone remembered my name (and number!) and took care of me. When I failed to buy a box spring (why oh why did I think I could go without a box spring??) they were able to take care of me over the phone and get me a box spring in the SAME day. Within hours, even. They even helped me set up the mattress that I DIDN'T purchase from them, which blew me away. 

Their professionalism and friendliness are excellent. I will recommend them to everyone who's in the market for a mattress, especially students, because their student deals are fantastic.",1,Y4CcDDyMoDpK7BbpKawWjw,1,5,2012-09-11,review,2

Both my wife and I and our daughter desperately needed new mattresses so I decided to check this place out. We went on a Sunday afternoon and were the only ones in the store. Lee greeted us and showed us around the store. They offer mattresses, recliners, dinettes, daybeds, bunk beds and bedroom furniture. We found her a great mattress at a great price. While waking around the store my wife found a Serta iComfort series mattress for us that felt like heaven to lay on. 

Lee had told us about their free 18 month no interest financing through Wells Fargo Bank, free bed frame, free delivery and set up of your new bed and free removal of your old mattress and box spring which made it a no brainer! I went in to only buy our daughter a new mattress but I bought us a new one as well. No one can beat their prices! I compared the price of our new mattress to Levin, Macy's and Mattress Discounters. No one came close to the price we got at American Buyers. Everywhere else was double the price for just our mattress not including our daughters so it was like getting hers for free.
 
Take it from me, when it comes to your sleep, DO NOT BUY A CHEAP MATTRESS!!! We bought a cheap, supposed Serta mattress in 2008 from Mattress Discounters. The boxed spring had to be replaced about 2 years after owning the bed. I don't think I will have that problem again as our new Serta has a full 25 year warranty. 

A couple days later our daughters mattress was delivered first and about a week later our new mattress was delivered. The delivery guys had our old mattress and box spring out and our new frame, box spring and mattress set up in less than 10 minutes.

I highly recommend American Buyers Discount Mattress for all of your bedding needs.",1,Y4CcDDyMoDpK7BbpKawWjw,0,5,2013-02-11,review,3

Our driver Scott, was completely clueless in navigating the city. Constantly making wrong turns and missing exits. All of this after very thorough instruction as to where to go. Each destination took 3-4 times longer to reach due to his incompetence. This caused us to have to skip a couple of our originally planned stops. After returning to the bus after one of our stops we were informed by Scott that the police had come onto the bus and searched it with dogs. Really?!??!  Why??!!  How??!!  We found that our bags had been rifled through and we all felt a little violated and confused. By this point we decided to call it a night. More than half of our passengers didn't care to step back onto the bus and took cabs home. 

Just when we thought the worst was over we were wrong. As we enter the highway we realize that Scott has driven all the way up the ramp and onto the highway going THE WRONG WAY!!!  He starts slowly reversing down the ramp while oncoming cars honk and swerve all around us!  Truly terrifying. After that, we were very upset and just wanted to get home. So after several more wrong turns we finally get home. Absolutely terrible night.

This location is pretty standard; it has the expected mash-up of decorations around the walls that try to give the place a laid-back lounge feel and there's nothing outstanding about the menu or what they offer food wise (and like other Friday's, it's not particularly easy to eat here if you're anything other than a meat lover).

Honestly I wasn't expecting to eat here any time soon; I had called a few days before eating here while planning a day out with friends and asked about reservations for a large group (as it says on the T.G.I. Friday's website that it's ideal to call ahead when you have a large party). However, I was told on the phone that this location does not accept reservations. So my friends and I looked elsewhere, and finally walked across the street to Friday's after discovering just how darn long the waits at other restaurants were. At least Friday's only had a 15 minute wait.

Once we were seated our meal went by pretty uneventfully. I remember that we had to repeat ourselves a lot to our waitress and I had wondered why she was having trouble hearing us, but at least she was willing to ask questions and clarify things as opposed to taking a potentially wrong order back to the kitchen. Kudos. The food, as I mentioned earlier, was standard T.G.I.Friday's. Nothing particularly wrong with it, just not that exciting either. I had actually found one of the only low-calorie items on the menu at the last minute - a steak and vegetable dish - and standard or not I was honestly pretty happy with it. My steak was surprisingly juicy, came out fairly pink and was not overcooked at all (I'd ordered a medium temperature steak), and the simple and tasty vegetables offered a nice alternative to some of the other excessive dishes I saw on the menu. Not that that mattered after I ordered a rum punch cocktail, which mixed so much rum, fruit juice, sprite and other sugary beverages together that my teeth probably rotted a little bit in my head. It was worth it, though - that drink was a sweet, tall cup of Heaven.

This T.G.I.Friday's really fits my exact definition of an ""a-ok"" place - it's not terrible, nor is it not exceptional. It's just a decent place to grab a bite or to enjoy a drink. I'd consider coming back again, but admit that they wouldn't be my first choice so much as a solid back-up plan for when other Waterfront eateries are super busy.",1,tU-YtoW339PXJmUGSix_AQ,1,3,2015-03-30,review,0

First, when you walk in the restaurant has a very stale grease smell that permeates throughout the restaurant, nothing visibly dirty, but smells like the entire joint needs de-greased. Second, the service, the host was a typical younger girl, efficient without too much professionalism, not a big deal. The waitress, a ""professional"" , but unfortunately not in the way of experienced great service, but moreso as experienced in efficiently moving things along.  Our food took a long time, and she 'saved' herself by telling us that she didn't know why our food wasn't ready yet, but would check again, and of course, hot plates with luke-warm food came out soon after. She reeked of cigarette smoke, so i'm going to make a dumb assumption and guess that's where she was.  The food, typical TGI-fridays food, good enough, for a chain restaurant.

gtJJBaQwTwE45NnNF0coVA,6u4fDpMm_peHhz1b-BV82w,"Today we dined indoors after a bike ride on the rail trail.  I realized I'd never been inside before, only out on the deck facing the trail/river.  While I love the outdoors and would always choose that first, it wasn't available today so inside we go.  This particular Friday's is nice inside with space between tables.  The one in Monroeville seems quite a bit more cramped.  

The purpose of this update is to brag about their burger.  OMG! This was the best burger I've enjoyed for quite some time.  I've been to specific burger joints that just simply try too hard and either I've had bread components that fell apart immediately upon being held or various edible entities on the burger that just didn't go well together or overpowered the burger itself.  

Here, I opted for the ""your call burger"" in which you select a cheese, a spread, and 2 toppings for 11.95 and it comes with fries.  I opted for Smoked Gouda for my cheese, the Truffle Aioli for my spread and Onion-Bacon Jam and Crispy Cajun Onions for my toppings.  Note that the spread comes on the side which is nice as I didn't use very much.  

Again, let me rave about it and tell you this is the best burger I've had in a long time.  The burger was moist and juicy and well-complemented by the cheese/toppings/spread/bun.  I ate every morsel plus the fries plus a small side salad and was a happy diner.

That is all.  Thank you.",7,tU-YtoW339PXJmUGSix_AQ,2,5,2016-04-20,review,4

INVBi5surB5UbeDXWmqSuQ,vAuEnU_IM5kdoFFeri_8Iw,"I really don't know why I bother with chain restaurants anymore.  Now that my palate has matured and I no longer think chicken fingers and french fries are gourmet cuisine, I really can't find anything to eat in a place like this.  

My husband and I were running errands at the Waterfront, and we needed to find a place for lunch.  We decided on Uno because pizza sounded good to us.  My husband is a meat lover, so I agreed to let him order us a meat-covered pizza.  To counteract this a little, I ordered a tomato mozzarella salad, so we'd at least have some vegetables in the mix.  

When the salad arrived, it did NOT look like the picture.  The menu description is thus: ""chopped lettuce, roma tomatoes with basil and garlic, buffalo mozzarella, drizzled with balsamic syrup.""  This description is accompanied by a bright, colorful picture of a salad with bright green lettuce, bright red tomatoes, and a delicate ""drizzling"" of balsamic syrup.  It looks light and yummy.

What we got, however, was soggy yellow and white iceberg lettuce, COMPLETELY DRENCHED in dressing, a total of four tiny pieces of tomato, and some cheese.  It was DISGUSTING.  There was so much dressing dripping off of this dish, it was more like a soup than a salad.  I suspect that the lettuce was so wilted and brown, they figured they could disguise it by completely soaking it in dressing.  Not only was it disgusting, but it cost us about $10.  $10 for complete inedible slop.  

The ""numero uno"" pizza we got was nothing to write home about either.  It was ok... very mediocre.  The crust tasted like it was undercooked, and the sauce tasted like plain tomato sauce with no seasoning whatsoever.  I have been to Chicago many times, had real Chicago deep dish many times, and this just doesn't even come close to the real thing.  

The ONLY positive I give this restaurant is they have the kiosk in the front where you can look up the calorie count of the food right there.  It would be better if they'd actually print it on the menu, but they are still doing better than most restaurants in this effort.  They are making strides, too, with their whole grain crust options.  I'm sure there's still a lot of room for improvement, however.  If you're listening, Uno, please work on providing your customers with healthier food - not just healthy options like salads, but work on making the main dishes you serve better for your customers (low-fat cheese, low-sugar sauce, less sodium, etc.).   Their hearts will applaud you.  

And lastly, why does every chain restaurant have to decorate with old signs?  Is there some sort of chain restaurant decorating requirement I don't know about?  It's baffling.",0,6p9TlP2I8S4agxYMNFSDjg,0,2,2011-12-27,review,0

T_wjLgPOPXry7Bea4MzoVQ,8ndEF_w1kfWZnmdazV7E1g,"I really love deep dish pizza. The thick crust that is crunchy on the outside and soft on the inside. The spicy, peppery sauce that can singe your tongue. The mixture of ingredients just sliding down your chin as it bubbles out of your mouth. That being said, I really don't understand why people go to Pizzeria Uno. This chain has done to the deep dish pizza what McDonald's has done to hamburgers, Pizza Hut has done to pan pizza, Dominoes has done to hand tossed pizza, and Taco Bell has done to Tex-Mex; it has made it almost unpalatable. On our menu:

French onion
Chicken bites
Pizza with pepperoni, hamburger, and romano

Looking past the fact that the service was not the best or the fact that the food came out undercooked and tepid in temperature, the food just was not good.

Sure, it isn't a world class dining establishment, but it is decent considering it is a chain.  You should know that going into any chain, really.  It was basically exactly what I expected in terms of food quality and price.

We were greeted immediately upon entering, and while the hostess went to grab menus, another server asked us if we were taken care of.  Service at our table was very attentive and water and other beverages were promptly refilled.  I ordered soup and two appetizers instead of an entree or pizza and the server made sure to ask me about the order in which I would prefer receiving my food.  

My fiance ordered a deep dish pizza and we know they take longer to make than other food items.  It was quicker than we thought it would be and he really enjoyed it.  I had the potato skin appetizer.  It reminds me of a ""baked potato pizza"" that I used to enjoy at a local place back in Buffalo.  It was delicious, especially with the addition of a little bit of hot sauce.

Overall, it doesn't even come close to visiting an Uno's in Chicago, but then again, when does a copy every live up to the original?

Ordered the traditional deep dish pizza, but with no onions. Now after we ordered, it just went downhill from there. Was never asked if I wanted another beer, the waitress just gave me more water. My pizza still had onions in it. Which I stated right off the bat, that I didn't blame the girl who took my order. I know cooks can't read. I was one for many years. Mistakes happen, and the manger took care of it and took the item off my bill. NO complaints, still ate the food and it was good. Just not a fan of onions on my pizza. 

Now onto the bill, the server continues to tell me that she was sorry for the mistake and declares she told the cooks not to add onions. I already said it was taking care of and there's no worries. She goes on to say that the next day was her birthday, and if I felt like leaving all my money as a tip, it wouldn't go unnoticed. I took this as a joke as I had told her earlier I worked in the industry. When I hand over the gift card I had on hand, she comes back and again repeats herself, tells me that cash as a tip is preferred as she doesn't have to claim it at the end of the night. And again if I felt like leaving her all my money, she would just be so freaking happy. Let me explain one thing and hopefully I am very clear on it. No server, and I mean NO server anywhere, should ever ask a guest or customer for a tip, yet alone, do it twice! So out of kindness, which I shouldn't have left anything by this point.

I hadn't been here and years and some friends invited us out for the evening. I was so glad they were paying cause  I was low on funds at the time.

We arrived on a friday night and of course it was busy there. We waited about 10 minutes to get a table which wasn't bad considering the crowd. We looked over the menu and they have so many great choices. Pizza, pasta, appetizers, seafood, burgers, salads and sandwiches. 

After ordering two mango lemonades that were wayyyyy over sweetened we ordered our food. We both are going gluten free which is tough but UNO's gave us a nice selection of dishes to choose from. Plus! They make a thin crust gluten free pizza which taste great. My hubby ordered the mediterrean thin crust because he loves kalamata olives and I ordered the Guac-alicious burger with a Caesar side salad. My salad came out pretty quick which was nice but it had a little too much dressing on it. I didn't complain, it still tasted great.

I'm not into red meat so I tried to order a black bean burger or get chicken instead of beef, but the ran out of black bean and they couldn't get the chicken so i just ordered it anyway. The burger was piled really high with all the toppings including guacamole and it was very creamy but i couldn't get over the taste of the burger because it just didn't have any flavor. Very saddening. I ended up just eating the veggies and discarding the meat. I snacked on some of my hubbies pizza even though it was only a small amount. 

We came here twice in one week. The second time we ordered the 9-grain deep dish with mushrooms, parmesan and a garlic white sauce. Was this pizza amazing or what?? I will probably always eat this pizza whenever I come.

DwXVdLxCHp9Uag-HjWgcnQ,2XFf4KdtyvaQ5gYEuGm4dA,"Pizza is a staple for me. I love everything about crunch crust, a nice rich tomato sauce, and a thick layer of melted cheese. I have never tried Chicago style pizza before and when we had to rescue our friends from car troubles, Uno's was right there so we decided to try it out. 

Only a 30 minute wait for a Saturday is pretty good for any restaurant in the Waterfront. We were seated at a booth in the bar area. The tables were clean and it was a big booth so the four of us were not squished. Only complaint, the bar was loud and when they did blended drinks you had to pause your conversation because the blenders were so loud. Good news, only happened twice!

The four of us decided to order two pizzas, the Pepperoni and the Farmers Market. I also ordered a Caesar salad because I needed more vegetables in my life.  

The salad. It was a big salad that I shared with my boyfriend. The croutons were huge and very crunchy. The Caesar dressing was not creamy, it was vinegar based and had a little bit of a ""bite"" to it as Chris kept on saying. I thought the bite had more to do with the vinegar than anything spicy, but who am I to say.  The lettuce was fresh and crunchy and they even added tomatoes like I requested. 

The main dishes came out about 10 minutes later. I do not know what I was expecting but the pizzas were not as large as I was imagining. Two of the larger pizzas looked like personal pizzas to me. But!!!! I was soon to see that even if they are a bit smaller they were filled to perfection. 

The Farmers Market pizza had caramelized onions, spinach, SUN DRIED AMAZING TOMATOES, regular tomatoes, eggplant, pesto as a sauce, and a blend of cheeses. The crust was perfection being so crisp and light that I stole Chris' extra from his plate. The sun dried tomatoes were great adding just enough sweetness to the pizza that I went looking for the slices with the most on them. It was a really really good pizza. We even ended up taking slices home with us! My eyes deceived me at first with the size! 

Then our friends told us that we had to try the cookie pizza. Cookie pizza? What sorcery is this? Matt, the one who suggested it said that we would not be disappointed. This cookie came out in a really large, bigger than our pizzas, dish. It had three scoops of icecream on it with a pile of whipped cream. WARM, right out of the oven, fresh cookie pizza. Oh sweet heavens, it was good. I am glad that I had enough room in my stomach to pile in that sweet goodness.

We were greeted and seated well. But later the service was not all good. Bad bad service. First of all we had to ask for everything we wanted.

It was fairly crowded for a weekday but we were seated in less than ten minutes.  The waitress was friendly and knowledgeable about the menu answering all our questions with ease.  I settled on a Turkey, Bacon and Avocado sandwich and old fashioned tomato soup after looking over the menu several times.  They have a variety of dishes guaranteed to please all ages.  The food arrived in no time and was DELICIOUS!  The portions were just right for lunch, I was definitely ready for an afternoon of shopping.  The four of us had items off the Two for U lunch menu, our bill was less than $30 which meant that I might could afford the shoes I wanted to buy!

And this location has the same look and feel as the old pizza hut before it went take out. 

So this is the old style pizza hut. 

Very family orientated dining style. You can sit here for hours. And so we did. We had a heap of use in a long table.

I ordered one of the small pizzas which were buy 1 get one free. Disappointed in the selection of that. Seeing other choices... I regretted going on the cheap.

I've dreamed of their pizza since I was a child. My only encounter with my beloved Uno was when my mother came home with a take out box that she ordered for lunch that day.  I would scarf down the thick wedges of pizza and greedily pick off the loose toppings from the box. The cold 4 hour old pizza has since plagued my mind.  I desperately tried to find an Uno but found that the nearest one had closed down. CLOSED DOWN. My dreams were crushed, my psyche disturbed. I had become a changed person. I wanted more. I needed more. My mother stopped coming home with Uno take out boxes. I stopped eating pizza. I hated the flimsy crusts that were just cheap variants from my beloved Uno, I despised the New york style that you could so easily fold. Feh, I would resign from eating pizza till I had my precious. My precious, my Uno deep dish. 

It wasn't until that fated day when I drove past an Uno. The neon lights called out to me, it was like seeing heaven for the first time. I stumbled into the Uno. Dazed, the smell was like nothing I had ever experienced on this green Earth.  There was nothing I could compare it too. I sat down and ordered the Numero Uno with a side of fries.  ""No not personal...Regular."" I wanted the entire thing, not just a wedge of a dream. I wanted the whole thing. 

It came out, steaming. Bubbling. Oozing. Fresh. So fresh. I took a bite - the cheese was perfectly melted. And then another - the dough was so thick and tasteful. And then another - ooh that sausage...
Until there was nothing left. 

I had achieved my dream. But I will be back for more. I will be back..for my precious.

1zJL9PogiFyd_NhGcbgs7Q,Szko97-w2vopTrjLiKJP9A,"I am glad that Western Pennsylvania has one remaining outlet for the great Chicago-style deep dish pizza offered by Uno, its pioneer.  Dining here brought back memories of an excellent meal I enjoyed in Chicago last month at Uno subsidiary, Pizzeria Due.

The restaurant is attractive and comfortable, and the outdoor seating by the river a delight.  The tables outside, though, are too close and if all are occupied, one can hear every word of what is said at neighboring tables.

The spinach and chicken pizza, appetizers of zucchini chips and spinach and artichoke dip were all delicious, but the zucchini was extremely salty.

Our server was pleasant and attentive, performing many quality checks.  $20.99 is a lot to pay for a pizza, but the deep dish pies are hearty and plenty for two people. $7.75 for a small glass of house wine is excessive.  The $4.99 tariff for the single serving appetizers was fair for the quality and the portion sizes.

The weak link was the young lady who seated us.  She was glum, unfriendly, and without a smile.  Instead of saying ""Enjoy your meal"" when seating customers, she says, ""There you are.""  How a customer is greeted can set the tone for a meal and this is an important facet of the front of the house operation. At The Cheesecake Factory, the host staff is trained to engage the customer in pleasant conversation while leading the guest to the table. The individual at Uno got us off to a poor start.

The kids menu has an make your own pizza option, which is always a fun activity for them. They also have a choice of a personal pizza(not a make your own), Mac and cheese, tiny Dino chx nuggets, kids sliders, and hot dog, and more. They also had a good choice of sides for them as well. Fries, grapes, broccoli, a side salad, and rice.
   The lunch menu is what we ordered from today, which is a must when you go for lunch. They have a pick 2 menu with 3 pick options. $6.99 you can get a choice of endless soup bar with 4 different soups, and a choice of salads. $7.99 you get a choice of endless soup bar and either a pizza of the day or sandwich or a salad. And the 8.99 choices(I didn't make it that far on the menu for choices), I think it was a choice of salad and a choice of either pizza or pasta dish? 
   The kids personal pizza was about 8 inches and filling. The Mac and cheese was also big and had a side of a breadstick. Both choices were good portion sizes to fill my lil ones bellies. 
   The honey crisp chicken salad was a dinner size(it was big), with lettuce, tomato, red bell pep, onion, cheddar cheese, little crisps, and crispy chicken tenders, topped with a honey mustard dressing. It was a big portion and very delish. The 2nd choice was a personal deep dish pizza. Very good.
   The soup bar today had minestrone, clam chowder, broccoli and cheddar, and tomato. All the soups at the bar were served warm and very tasteful. And the fact that they had tobasco at the bar, won my heart. The second lunch choice was a flat bread prosciutto and arugula. The flat bread was brushed with a garlic and oil, with mozzarella, then the prosciutto and arugula, red bell peppers and topped with a balsamic glaze! It was the regular dinner size and so yum for half the cost!

The roasted eggplant, spinach, and feta flatbread also tasted fresh, which surprised me considering the short wait of 5 minutes or so. The entire dish was layered with thick slices of tomato, and I liked actually being able to taste the eggplant. The pesto sauce was prominent without overpowering the other elements of the dish. Well worth the $12 Pick and Choose price IMO. I did find a curly, black, and fine strand of hair at the side of the salad plate, so a small star off for that.

I had a coupon for a free dessert,  so I asked for the mini chocolate peanut butter cup. It was good but not memorable. I liked that there were mini chocolate chip with the peanut butter though. I'm not sure if the outer chocolate was intended to be rock hard or if the cold ice cream on it had simply hardened it, but it was extremely difficult to cut through with a mere spoon.

Our waitress finally came and took our orders. While we were waiting for food there was a waitress standing right inside the kitchen door complaining about her day job.

I like the versatility here with the varied menu. Sometimes, I don't even come here for the pizza. While the pizza is definitely the star of the show, their steak is also pretty tasty as are the sandwiches. 

The food is enjoyable but the main reason why this is a go-to for me and my friends is because the service is usually very quick here.

nEYPahVwXGD2Pjvgkm7QqQ,SjMhVjU7Qs_7Hizw5qjhhw,"Interesting the reviews here are less than stellar already. I would normally not review a chain retail store, but the service I received today just really got my blood boiling.

I will state, as I always do in these types of situations, that I have worked many years in retail. I know what you're supposed to do. I know the ways I've displayed exemplary service and I know the ways I've slacked off. I get it, I really do.

So I'm in the store early. Hardly any people in there. Weird for the Semi-Annual Sale time of year. Usually it doesn't matter what time you're there during the sale, it's always busy. 

I went through my usual bins and picked up a mess of undies and bras. Since no one was at the check out counter and I needed a spot to go through things, I set them down and started to try and chat with the sales chick. I actually always like to do this, just to shoot the breeze, but also to get their opinions on items I'm buying. 

The girl behind the counter was having non of this though.I asked her about a bra and she said she didn't know about that one, but said it should work. I understand, you can't try them all. But the thing that really irked me was that she was definitely not hiding her annoyance at me setting down my things on the counter. I even looked back to make sure there were no people checking out behind me. Ghost town. Tumbleweed rolled by. No one.

So I'm going through my stuff and separating what I want and don't want and she's sighing and grabbing things saying ""Soooo, you DON'T want these???"" Um, I'm not asking you to help me sort things.

After some time, they told me twice that it was such a cute dress while lingering on it like looking at their dead pet. I know it was a cute dress, the very reason why I bought it at the first place. It is not my fault that they don't have dresses in the store to try them on. Dresses are only available online.

Q3fFv_ft17OyV-NRF1iQxw,HOsdJtTnUDJcuhnOR4DP-g,"Within the last six months, Loft has become my go-to store for tops. My daily commute takes me by the Waterfront every day, so it's easy to pop into this location and check out their newest inventory. Loft does a great job of turning inventory quickly. Every couple weeks, the store has new product with a full clearance section. I'm also signed up for the brand's emails so I know when promotions are going on. They offer 30-40% off the store every month or so (generally around major holidays) and also offer 40-50% off clearance pretty frequently.

I enjoy the layout and store appearance much better than Ross Park and Robinson. Ross Park's store is very bland, and Robinson is currently in a temporary store. Shopping in an environment with bright fluorescent lights and boring white walls is just terrible, so I enjoy the Waterfront's pretty street-side location best.

The employees at this location are just OK. Sometimes I am cheerfully greeted at the front door but am generally ignored the entire time that I am shopping. I recently had a very attentive sales associate who opened a fitting room for me when my arms were becoming full, but I thought that I noticed someone with a District Manager vibe lurking around, which probably encouraged the associate's motivation. 

I actually had a very negative experience at this store during a recent sales event. The event ended at 7pm on a weekday, and I rushed to the store after getting off work. I hurried around the store and jumped into line at 7:02pm. All associates abandoned the registers at 7pm, totally ignoring me and the other two girls waiting in line. When I was finally helped several minutes later, the snippy associate told me that the discount may or may not go through... that corporate determined when the discount was turned off. OK, that's great, but then why did you totally ignore me and your other customers for several minutes? Did you want us to not get the discount? I was appalled by the rudeness of both the associate and a manager I spoke with earlier in the evening, who was equally rude about the sharp end time of the discount. What made the situation much worse is that a good friend of mine was a manager at Loft a couple years ago and told me that ringing up after 7pm would not be a problem. Hah, well it was a problem at the Waterfront location!

The only reason that I gave Loft 4 stars is because I love the brand, discounts, and quality of product as a whole. The staff at this location is sub-par and do not reflect the brand well. I hope that Loft does not lose customers based on negative customer service experiences.... They're lucky that I like the product enough to ignore some occasional rudeness.",1,FituZ4jYzRe41ac9uvcHaQ,0,4,2012-10-20,review,0

q_u-rcJTi2nQzeWQ92rJtg,i1CT1TfopKzakyWsvxrzig,"When I lived in Los Angeles a year and a half ago, P F Chang's was no great shakes, one of millions of places with good but not outstanding stuff on the menu.

Here in Pittsburgh, it's the only Chinese place I've found that combines genuinely good service with quality food.  Not, perhaps, as good as what you can get in LA's top places, but fantastic compared to its competition here.

The Kung Pao chicken is particularly good, with delicious fried chicken cubes and the usual hot sauce and chiles.  Chicken with lettuce wraps is good too.

Their fried noodle dish with chicken, whose name I have forgotten, is addictive but has an odd sauce I don't quite like.  Still, they get the friedness of the noodles right, and there are precious few ... ahem ... no other restaurants around here that do.

Portions are small, so either plan to get an appetizer and an entree or expect to leave almost as hungry as you came.  The minced chicken in lettuce wraps appetizer is outstanding and you get about the same amount of food as in one of their entrees.

If you live in LA, forget P F Chang's.  If you live in NYC, I'm sure there are a dozen better places on a single block.  But here in Pittsburgh, it's just about the best place around.",1,JDDeaNfb0JXD1NbznSIC9g,0,4,2005-12-28,review,0

iykSymLl4s0M1oKE_BY6tw,mCZQEYD29BVJ5Oz-wcIthw,"Any place that accommodates with a special dietary menu for a little known disease gets five stars from me.  P.F. Chang's has a dedicated Gluten-Free Menu for those of us who suffer from celiac disease.  They also make sure to clean down the area they prepare the specialty dinner so as to avoid cross-contamination.  I don't know many other restaurants that go this far.

Aside from the menu preference, I enjoy my overall experience every time.  Their menu is a bit different than that of what most people will be used to if you regularly eat a Chinese Take-Out or Buffet joints.  Don't expect this to be at all like that.  It's not a Buffet.  They don't sell ""General Tso's"" (though Chang's Spicy Chicken is recommended for those looking for something similar, it's my personal favorite) or other signature foods that you may expect.  They do sell very similar items with different names and a few of their own adjustments, just make sure to read the menu description and ask questions if you are not sure.  They also sell Sake, I believe they have a few different types.  

The prices can get a bit more expensive than your average Chinese Restaurant depending on what you get but it's well worth it.  Portions are excellent and the taste is great.  I've yet to have one complaint and I have frequented this establishment several times over the span of a few years.

The only downside, it can be a little crowded and a bit loud.  It's also very dark because of their lighting.  However, I think it sets the atmosphere.  It can be a romantic place or a casual place, I've been there for both.",2,JDDeaNfb0JXD1NbznSIC9g,2,5,2009-01-08,review,3

I went to PF Chang's several years ago and was NOT pleased with the food that was presented to me.  

My issue: I thought I was getting Chinese food.  

My resolution: Try this restaurant again knowing that it is just reinvented American food with names of those Chinese dishes I actually like to eat.

So we returned to PF Chang's for lunch to try this American food in this caricature of a Chinese restaurant.  There were very few people in the restaurant.  The two of us were seated in the largest corner booth and left to review our menus.  When our waitress finally arrived we ordered the following items:

Coca Cola
Iced Tea
Pan fried pork dumplings
Sesame chicken lunch with white rice and egg drop soup
Changs chicken with white rice

Our drinks and my soup came out immediately.  Unfortunately I was brought the wrong soup and the server had disappeared before I had a chance to say anything.  I could see her across the barren wasteland that was the dining room and we even made eye contact several times, but at no point could I get her to come back to my table.  I tried the soup and was disgusted with it and placed it at the end of the table.  I didn't know what it was and didn't want to know.  Almost ten minutes later she arrived quite happy with the job she was doing and asked how the food was.  I asked if she could bring out some egg drop soup. I didn't expect to get the stink-eye.

My egg drop soup was brought out with the dumplings as well as the caddy of different sauces and oils.  The server really wasn't that into the experience, but again gave me the stink-eye when I told her that mixing the sauces was unnecessary since I knew what each of them was and would be able to mix them myself.  I mixed the rice vinegar, chili oil, chili paste, and soy sauce (my guess is that it was supposed to be tamari) to create a dipping sauce for our dumplings. I took a bite of the soup and it was somewhat better than the other soup, but it was still brown.  I ate half the bowl and left the rest for the server.  It was thick and gooey and the flavor didn't wow.  I saw no reason to continue.  I moved on to the dumplings, which had an okay flavor to them.  The skins were a bit thick and doughy.  The meat on the inside did not balance this attribute at all.  The sauce tasted a little odd so I tried to remix and it was still off.  I tried the components individually and found that some of them were either old, stale, or rancid.  We finished our dumplings.

Our lunch entrees arrived.  I had ordered mine extra-spicy, but I guess it came Pittsburgh Hot (super mild) and had a lackluster flavor at best.  The meat was tough and the sauce tasted of soy sauce more than anything else.  I tried some of Chang's chicken and was equally mollified.  This was supposed to be their version of General Tso's Chicken.  Now I have never had a General's chicken that was the same at any place.  It is always different.  Many of them are good in different ways.  This food, though, it wasn't good.  Chang's chicken fell into the same category as the Sesame Chicken -- since it tasted mainly of soy sauce -- with the addition sugar.  

I just don't understand how anyone can like this place.  Even the Yoshida Sauce you get at Sam's/Costco tastes better.",2,JDDeaNfb0JXD1NbznSIC9g,3,2,2009-11-30,review,2

Over the last year, we have tried repeatedly, but the 90-120 minute wait for dinner is unacceptable. We tried going early, late -- it never made any difference. The front staff was rude, and the wait was too long.

Tonight, we had a special date planned, and made reservations a week in advance. We came in the door exactly on time, waited in the line to see the front staff, and we were promptly handed a pager. They couldn't tell us when we would be seated.

I imagined a short wait, so we went outside, crossed into a store to wait (since the entrance of this location is so packed, it's impossible to wait at the bar or in the meager seating).

After 20 minutes we gave up. We went back to PF Chang's and the front office staff still couldn't tell us when we would be seated. I saw open tables.

What on earth is the point of accepting reservations if you do not honor them?

The food here is good, but certainly not great. We went to a local Thai place and were seated with no problem in 5 minutes. The food was much better, the service was good even in a crowded busy restaurant. Oh, and the local place was a much more reasonable price.

Got there at 8pm on Saturday night, they told us it was an hour wait which was expected, but it only took 30minutes to be seated so that was a bonus.  Started off with the lettuce wraps and i used to be a fan of these but they just seem to bore me now(FYI-love the lettuce wraps at the cheesecake factory).  I had the Singapore rice noodles.  This was so so as i thought immediately that lu lu noodles and asian cafe are better.  The fried rice was disappointing and the vegetables tasted raw.   Some good notes were the Dynamite shrimp, plump, juicy, tangy with a small kick.    Sweet and sour chicken was just the same minus the kick. 

The service was annoying.   We were there less than 45 minutes and it seemed like our waiter was in a rush to get us out of there.   Constantly asking if he could remove my plate.  I had to sternly say at one point that I will let you know when i am finished.  I found it rude especially since  there wasn't even a line at this point.

The portions are big and the food is ""alright"" and the interior gives you the superficial impression that you're encountering fine dining.

The food is sooooo bland though. Everything you get at P.F. Chang's you can get elsewhere in Pittsburgh at a much lower cost and it'll be made with more precision and have better flavor. The honey chicken at P.F. Chang's was so mediocre all I could think about while eating it was heading over to Wai Wai in Bloomfield and getting a tastier order of it for 8 bucks.

Last time we were there the server was horrendous as well. I don't think I've ever felt as awkward at a restaurant. He brought my girlfriend's father (Don) his unsweetened tea then told him he didn't bring sugar because he asked for it sweetened and then did not understand the concept of sweetening it yourself. He then got all huffy when Don kept asking for it and actually seemed angry at us. When he came back to take our order Don ordered for himself and his wife and before Janey (my girlfriend) and I could order he had already started to walk away. We actually had to yell out to get him to come back and finish our order. (not in an uncivilized or malicious way, either) After that he must have thought we were terrible diners (I don't think I've ever been impolite to someone who is currently at work, or ANYONE for that matter) and he showed it by being silent and plopping things down in a passive aggressive way. It was really embarrassing and every time he came by the conversation died.

Obviously the attitude of one idiot who can't hide his bad day well doesn't really have anything to do with the restaurant. But it's soooooo bland! Go somewhere else for Chinese!

Warning: even though it's vegan, it still contains the same amount of salt that was reported on all the news channels when the salt, fat, and cholesterol police made the sodium content available to the public. The vegan version is just as delicious and the chicken.

This was my first time here and I honestly wasn't sure what to expect. The first thing I noticed when I walked in was the layout of the dining area. It seemed less intimate than I had pictured in my mind. The tables were all jammed together and the restaurant had a crowded feel to it. Fortunately, there wasn't a long wait as we had made a reservation. 

We were seated at a table in the middle of the dining room alongside a busy throughway. It seemed all the servers were destined to walk past our table. I appreciated that their menu pointed out that their meals were ""meant to be shared."" My wife and I decided to share our two meals: Chang's Spicy Chicken and Double Pan Fried Noodles. Before our meal came out our waitress set some sauces on the table in a ""here's your sauce"" kind of way. I remember thinking, ""That's very nice, but I have no idea why you just gave us sauce."" There was no explanation - just a little tray of sauces. Our food came out and she finally asked if we like mild, medium, or hot sauce. We picked medium and, with a few scoops, she turned our three sauces into three mixed sauces and I still didn't know what they were for. 

Forget the sauce though, my attention was now drawn to our meal. For meals that were ""meant to be shared"" these sure are little portions. I guess when you go for that high-end presentation you can charge 50% more for 50% less. The food itself was good (in an ok sort of way). I can't say it was the best I've had, but it was good enough. 

Overall I thought the experience was lacking. P.F. Chang's tries to be classy, but does it in a cafeteria sort of way. I was constantly distracted by the front doors opening and icy air pouring across the room. The music didn't fit the ambiance. Our table felt like it was in the middle of the road. The restaurant was loud and crowded. The girls at the table next to us were taking those annoying duck-face puckered lip pictures...  

I think our experience may have been different if we were seated at one of the booths along the side of the restaurant, but no such luck.",0,JDDeaNfb0JXD1NbznSIC9g,0,3,2012-02-24,review,0

sS2sSWqZMnQMRoWx-Mdzgg,HqfO-XN-C-3P0GkddKYkbA,"I've always liked PF Chang's and, generally speaking, this location is pretty good. I typically opt to sit at the bar, where the service has always been extremely personable and fast.

The food is typical PF Chang's: delicious. As one of the chains that provides their nutritional information, it's also nice to know that I can go there and eat somewhat healthy (I'm all about the orange peel shrimp and steamed shrimp dumplings). While some complain about the portion sizes being too small, I've always felt like they were perfect. I do understand how someone looking at a $15 plate of ""Chinese"" food could wonder why he or she is paying more for less than your standard Chinese restaurant, but it's never bothered me. Most of the meals are consistently good, freshly prepared, and full of flavor. Plus, the sauce that your waiter/waitress makes for you is always a nice addition to any meal. I've tried most of the apps, soups, and quite a few of their entrées and have never been disappointed.

I've only had one negative experience at this location in the countless times that I've gone, and it revolved around service in the main dining area. I was there for lunch, and the waitress essentially disappeared. I'm not sure if she had been fired, quit, or what, but she took the order and was never seen again. After sitting there for what seemed like an eternity with empty drinks, etc., I finally had to ask if someone else was going to be our server. I had never experienced something like that, but I received free food vouchers for a future visit, and luckily I wasn't in a rush that day, so it worked out. The experience would've made me give the location a worse rating, but one bad experience hasn't outweighed the countless positives: good meals, solid service (especially at the bar), and great takeout service for large orders and smaller ones.

The only other knock on this location - and it applies to every PF Chang's I've been to - is the insane wait that you'll encounter at dinner time. My wife and I would actually go there more often if we didn't have to wait forever for a table. I love PF Chang's, but I hate waiting more. If you live close enough, get curbside pick-up, or just find somewhere else. I've yet to meet a restaurant worth a 2-hour wait.

ROX0FasafqFknZKaTwgf0Q,pd_8UmwCAvptIRFSw4aMsw,"Let me start off by saying I have mostly simple tastes, and my favorite lunch spot for Chinese has been the New Dumpling House in Squirrel Hill. But since that restaurant is undergoing renovations, I was forced to try something new.

So... I thought I'd try the chain PF Chang's Chinese Restaurant at the Waterfront. Wow, what an unsatisfying mistake that turned out to be.

I started with a cup of their Wonton soup. At $2.95 it wasn't too outrageous of a price, the broth had some flavor and there was much more in it than I was used to, including three giant basil (I think?) leafs that covered everything beneath. In the broth were chunks of chicken, two shrimp, some sliced water chestnuts and two ""pork""-filled wontons. As I said, the broth had decent flavor, but the wontons were thick, doughy and under-cooked, and the chicken chunks were dry, which is amazing since they were drowned in broth! On a scale of bad to good, it was kind of meh.

Next came my ""lunch-portion"" order of Chang's Kung Pao Chicken (the dinner portion is $5 more). 

At the New Dumpling House, this dish is served with a delectable dark, rich, tangy sauce, which I was really hoping for... Not at PF Chang's. 

On my plate I received about 8 quarter-size chunks of lightly breaded and browned chicken, 7 hot Chinese red chili peppers (mostly inedible unless they are diced into a sauce), a handful of blanched, unsalted peanuts, a few sliced scallions, and a bed of the most bland brown rice I have ever encountered. Uncle Ben would've been ashamed if that stuff came out of one of his boxes.

Glaringly, there was NO SAUCE!. None at all.

I've had Kung Pao Chicken in New York City, San Francisco, and even from a hole in the wall in Bethel Park, PA that was much, much better. Never have I had it served in such a bland, skimpy, and overpriced way! The ""lunch-portion"" cost was $9.95.

At The New Dumpling House, I could have a delicious lunch, with soup, entree and complimentary hot tea, and I could leave satisfied with just $8 out-of-pocket -- and that includes the tip.

The service was decent. However, lesson learned. One and done. Never going back to PF Changs.",0,JDDeaNfb0JXD1NbznSIC9g,0,1,2014-05-09,review,0

This was the hottest new place on the restaurant scene and everyone wanted to try it. Fast forward to present day and you'd never believe that was ever the case. Chang's is poorly set up as one large open room that's rather noisy. Food came out quickly but was not as good as the Chinese take out we get from sesame inn. Spicy chicken was neither spicy nor very flavorful and had a mass-produced feel to it. Took half home to eat the next day but ended up throwing it out a few days later. Normally one of the great thing about getting Chinese is looking forward to the leftovers the next day!   Another minus was noticing how dirty the floor was on the way back to the bathroom. I don't expect a place to be immaculate in the middle of dinner service but this looked like the mcdonalds on Smithfield downtown.
The one bright spot was our waitress was very good and kept our water glasses filled. We just came from kennywood so we went through quite a few fill ups during our time there.

So you're charging a dollar more to give me the gluten-free version of a veggie, tofu, and rice platter?? Regardless, it's worth it to get the gluten-free soy sauce (which I buy for myself and I know isn't THAT expensive). When my dish comes out, it's literally just steamed veggies and rice. No tofu, no seasoning or sauce. I ask why there's no tofu and the response is that the tofu has gluten in it. When I ask if there should be any sauce (aka flavor) to the dish I'm informed I could've ordered any other gluten-free dish's sauce to go along with it. Thanks for the info now...yes I'll take the GF beef broccoli sauce on the side. The sauce comes out and it's actually tasty so my food was finally interesting enough to eat, even though now I'm extra annoyed at paying $10.50 for steamed veggies and rice and why the menu made no mention that you wouldn't get flavor or tofu. 
To top it all off based on how miserable I feel now, I'm pretty sure the beef broccoli sauce they brought out contained gluten anyway! So I paid more, got less, and still got gluten in my food!?!?

My husband enjoyed a glass of sake, and I had a mai tai that turned out to be delicious.  We split an order of lettuce wraps as an appetizer; they don't custom-make your sauce any more which is disappointing, but they did happily provide us with chili paste and hot mustard to doctor it up ourselves.  His Chang's Spicy Chicken (extra spicy) turned out great, and provided the extra requested heat.

A few of us ordered the lunch special with soups, my mom had ordered the butternut squash ravioli, and we also got an order of street noodles and started with summer rolls. Everything was great (the street noodles in particular are fantastic), but the service was a bit of a disaster- dishes came out more than 10 minutes apart from each other, a huge mood killer with a big family meal; a few dishes came out dirty; soups didn't come out at all; and our waitress made up excuses and didn't apologize when she had in fact missed some of our orders. We were feeling really ignored and discouraged, until we let Sean know. He took great care of us and went way, way out of his way to make up the experience. I really can't thank Sean enough for making sure we left in a good mood after what could have been a very negative experience.

      I came in with two of my friends for new years eve before continuing on to the remainder of the evening. We ordered drinks at the bar while we waited for our table. My friend and I ordered the Asian pear mojito, which was decent. My other guest ordered a jack and coke and was immediately depressed to discover that it was all jack Daniels and a splash of coke for color.
   When we got to the table, we were hoping for a better experience. Little did we realize, we would suffocate while holding our breath. 
      We ordered the combination fried rice, described  containing egg, chicken, pork, shrimp, and beef. When it arrived to the table, the only egg that was present was the ones we were wearing on our faces.
     We also ordered the honey chicken and the beef with broccoli and again hoped for better quality. There were no complaints with the chicken, the only star of this evening. 
      The beef was disappointing to say the very least. To start, the kitchen sent out Mongolian Beef, rather than the intended entree. When they refired the dish, and it was presented, it looked better than it actually was. Never in my life have I bit into a piece of beef and instantly fear cracking a tooth. The beef in the dish was tough, and crunched (again a new first for me).

Earlier this week, I had the misfortune of dining at the Waterfront P.F. Changs.  It was bitter cold outside. Their food is usually good, so my husband and I ducked in to get a bite before we went to the movies.  We were seated and we quickly ordered because we wanted to make our show time.  I didn't notice it at first, but I soon realized that it was cold in the restaurant. I asked about the heat and I was told that there was no heat - that it had broken earlier that day.  I asked our server why they hadn't mentioned this when we came in.  Well, I already know the answer to that - we would have turned around a gone somewhere else.  Then the manager came over and apologized.  I mentioned to him that it might have been nice to be warned about the heat (as I sat there in my coat).  He seemed to agree with me, but still allowed at least another 20 people enter the restaurant without saying a word to them. Not one word. Oh, he did offer me some dessert. That's what they usually do when someone has f**ked up.  In this case it didn't matter.  I quickly ate and left to make my movie.  This is the second bad experience I've had at this particular location.  Last time I was there, the floor was pretty dirty which always makes me nervous.  What does the kitchen look like?

DJS0o7mFgw55SnA2JwNrbg,FP6RS0EEt7T2ryy_ovMA_g,"I normally love this chain restaurant, but this wasn't a good experience.  We arrived on a Saturday afternoon and there were plenty of empty tables.   Our server was very perky and took our drink orders.   

One of the reasons we picked here is because they have a nice gluten free menu.  We ordered appetizers, soup and entrees.  Our soup arrived first which just irks me.   Appetizers first please!!!!!!     The wonton soup was good, a bit different than most since it contained several shrimp and water chestnuts. We then waited a long time for our dumplings.  They were presented by a kitchen staff and looked beautiful but they didn't bring plates and he dashed away before we could stop him.  Although our server had stopped by too many times before this, she was now nowhere in sight.  We just ate them off the serving plate. Good, not great.  Not really hot, especially after waiting all that time.  The server did come by at some point to apologize for the delay and explained that's why she brought soup first.

The manager and the server continued to keep dropping by to the point of annoyance.   We waited forever for our food which was crazy since there were few patrons.  

Our entrees came, again with no plates. We caught him this time and he slowly brought back 3 plates.   The bottom one was dirty and nobody in sight again. I got up and went to a serving station where a different server was standing and asked for a clean plate. He reached under the counter, pulled out a plate and then picked a white cloth up off the counter, wiped the plate and gave it to me.  I stated I didn't want a plate he had just wiped with a cloth laying on the counter and he stated it was how they cleaned their plates.   WHAT????????

I went back to the table and used a small bread plate for my meal.  I was truly disgusted.  The server stopped by and my husband started to tell her our situation but I stopped him since we had spent soooooooo much time talking with this server that I didn't want to prolong this anymore.  

As far as food goes, the gluten free Mongolian beef was good.  The lemon chicken was tough and too thick.  The fried rice had no eggs and wasn't hot.  Overall, not a great experience.",0,JDDeaNfb0JXD1NbznSIC9g,0,3,2016-05-10,review,0
AOVh6nNcbuOFvqMHlFCR1A,lIHZSj_esK6MfLAdK5ntpA,"Decent/friendly service.  Slow kitchen (on a slow night with less than 1/4 filled).  Uneven food preparation.

While the food could be very good, the place has very uneven quality in every aspect of the restaurant.  We had a large dinner (over 5 people and over $250 in total bill), and here's our impression.

1) Food - Appetizers were very good, Chicken Lettuce Wrap, great as usual.  Lobster/Shrimp Taco excellent.  Sushi was lackluster across the board, almost not worth ordering - you might get better ones off a buffet assembly line.  The soups were uneven - Wonton soup excellent.  Hot n Sour soup is dense and salty, and again, worse than a standard $5 Chinese restaurant buffet line.  Main Entree is uneven as well - not particularly flavorful.  The new entrees are hit and miss.  Lamb is good and tender, though tasted nothing like lamb (just beef-flavor, the sauce is very heavy).  But the Chilean Sea Bass (Hong Kong style), one of the most expensive item on the menu, is severely undercooked - we should have sent it back but did not (our fault).  This is how under-cooked it is - we tried to cut it with a knife, and cannot because the middle was NOT cooked.  And Sea Bass is so flaky and it's supposed to fall apart at the touch of a fork.

2) Service - Server is friendly, and accommodating to different requests.  Fresh plates are brought during change of courses.  On the other hand, the restaurant, though encouraging ""family style"" serving, does not quite know how to serve food in family style.  There are extended wait time between appetizer, to soup, to sushi, to entrees.  Family style would require items to be brought up as each is ready, rather than having guests wait for extended time and then have everything arrive at the same time.  For a place that was less than 1/4 seated, there was far too much wait time (20 min) between appetizer and just soup, and again extended wait between sushi and hot entrees.  By the time the main courses arrived, it was almost anti-climatic and people were pretty much full/tired.  It was not clear whose job it was to clear off the ""empty"" plates when food is eaten, a number of times it was piled up on the corners of a small table - again, at far cheaper buffet lines, these plates would have been cleared much, much sooner.

Over the last decade, our P.F. Chang experience have gone from excitement to just a periodic visit with out-of-town guests - and the uneven food and service experience is not likely to encourage many re-visits.",0,JDDeaNfb0JXD1NbznSIC9g,0,3,2016-05-13,review,0

You start off with a cup of soup, It is usually egg drop but they did let us substitute won ton for no additional cost. You then get a choice of an appetizer. We chose two egg rolls which we could split. You get the entree of choice. I had sesame chicken and my girlfriend had crispy honey chicken that was lightly battered and came with rice sticks.

I enjoyed the soup, egg rolls and my sesame chicken. It came with peppers and broccoli. It was very good. You can only order white or brown rice with this special. I would imagine fried rice comes for a slight uncharge. My friend liked her chicken but said that the rice sticks had no flavor to them. 

The last course was a dessert that was fried banana with a scoop of ice cream and some fruit.It came with two forks so it was a bit difficult to split in half but we managed. We liked the banana but weren't too fond of the ice cream. All in all it was a good deal for lunch. They do offer lunch specials during the week for smaller portions as well as cheaper prices.

They also sell orthotics which you can put in sneakers or special orthodics for dress shoes. If you have a foot problem they will give give you 10% off your purchase of the orthotic once your mention your doctor's name.

I normally come here for sneakers, sandals and on rare occasion a dress shoe. They offer a reward program for the amount of your purchase once you reach a certain threshhold.

I have never had a problem with any of my orthotics and give them a high recommendation. They do offer trunk shows which was the reason for my recent visit since I needed a pair of summer sandals and a waterproof sneaker for an upcoming trip. Normally they sell New Balance for sneakers and their prices are relatively comparable to that which you would find in other shoe stores.

However, the do carry some better lines so expect to pay a little more if you want the quality of a name brand shoe. You are permitted to purchase the items and try it around the house to see if you are comfortable with it. If unhappy then you have two weeks to return it at which point it becomes a final sale.

Time will normally tell if I had made the right purchase or not. I bought a pair of waterproof sneakers and an Allegra sandal which is versatile. They were kind enough to stretch the sneaker to make sure it wasn't bothering my bunion.

When I got to the local office to pick up my car, I was told that I needed insurance. Okay, that's fine. The man at the desk told me the rate was (his words) ""Seven dollars a day."" He said this at least twice. Over the course of the conversation, that became ""$25 for three days."" I didn't think much of that, because ""seven dollars a day"" works out to close to ""$25 for three days."" And when I got the actual receipt, it was $25 for EACH day. And as we all know, ""$25 for three days"" is very different from ""$25 a day.""

In addition to that, my rental was a little more than the $57 I was quoted on the 800-number. Not much more, but enough to make it not right.

So, my $57 rental, plus $7/day insurance, should have been about $88. Instead, my total was about $129.

Our food was made very quickly, even though the place was pretty busy (lunch on a Saturday).  Chicken noodle soup is tasty, but there was too much broth and not enough noodles and chicken.  I tried their Sierra Chicken sandwich for the first time, and it was pretty good.  It's very flavorful, I like whatever they put in their chipotle mayo.  It was a salty meal though - definitely had me running to the fountain machine to get more water.

If I have to get a quick, light meal and only chain options are available, Panera is my best choice.  It's definitely predictable and usually tasty.  But there isn't much special about it, of course.",0,FiXamVMgMf9U0VqFHDZSEA,0,3,2011-01-18,review,1

I am def a fan of this easy, better than fast food, time-killing eatery.

Great place for a lunch social/date with good eats and a good place to sit and talk for a while or to get some work done between appointments.

PROS:
Great Food;
Free WiFi (though some locations are limited to 30 minutes during the lunch hour);
Seating is always tricky at the lunch hour.

CONS:
pricey for salads, soup and sandwiches;
tables should be wiped more frequently--even if you have to ask a newly seated guest if they would like it wiped, the tables should be wiped!

I've been here a couple times and so far, no major complaints in terms of food and service. The people are generally friendly (honestly, they are probably the friendliest Panera staff I've seen in all of the Panera stores I've been to in Pittsburgh, although I haven't been to them all). Once, I came in after breakfast time and asked for a quiche and they gave it to me without any problems. I haven't had to wait super long, even if there are a lot of people. 

However, my biggest problem with this Panera store is that there are hardly any outlets and seating is rather a pain. I like to go to Panera to eat and do work at the same time but it's rather hard when there aren't many seats and very few outlets.

Food: 4 stars - just your average Panera food

The bakery items are always fresh. It's nice that they keep the chocolate chip cookies warm. Yum!
The food is unpredictable. Sometimes it's good and sometimes it's not so good. The serving sizes on their soups and salads have shrunk considerably in the last year. They do have a good selection of food. They keep adding healthier options. Their recent addition is Soba Noodle Bowls. They look good but I sense a lot of sodium hides in them.

Food is fair. You order and you are given a buzzer to let you know when your food is ready. They use real dishes and silverware. The menu gives you a calorie count of each item you are purchasing.  One of the popular feature items is you pick two where you can have half a sandwich or salad or soup in a pair of two of those items. You also get with it a choice of an apple or roll and you can add a dessert for $1.00

I was disappointed to learn they had removed the French onion soup from the menu. I asked about this removal only to learn there was something wrong with one of the ingredients. The other disappointment was that this year they are not making gingerbread men which are one of my favorite holiday treats. Instead they are offering a holiday themed sugar cookie.

-ke0O45_B6STtEqd5s_ANw,prGuQ-2xfCBEYgge7lwe2Q,"Target and I go way back like the driver's seat in my brother's car. Despite my murky history with Target, I prefer it way more over Walmart, which is closer to home. Just overall quality, atmosphere, and clientele is way better. 

We needed a large number of photos printed and my father had decided to go to FedEx. I can only imagine this decision because they're known for print quality. They should also be known for being cumbersome and overcharging. After an hour of struggling with their machines to print, we left. I suggested Target because we were in the area, and I halfway remembered that they used the Kodak app to develop pictures from your phone. 

As soon as we get in, it's always a win because pictures are 25¢, compared to 49¢ at their competitor. It was easy to sync up the photo library via wifi to the kiosk with the app. After choosing and modifying all of our pictures, we were given a slip stating our order of 63 pictures would be ready in 15 minutes. 

We picked up everything else we needed and checked out, finishing in 7 minutes. By then our photos were done and we checked out at the photo stand, paying less than half of what we anticipated paying at the other place. Plus the quality was fantastic, the photos weren't too glossy, and everything worked out perfectly. 

Will we be back? Absolutely!",1,ISKLP0qxApATxRlUDob6Cg,0,4,2015-10-27,review,2

I told the ignorant employee that i was asking just for a new one for free... how simple can that be. I paid 10 extra for my geek squad support and they couldnt even give me my free home phone that i deserved. I asked to speak with a manager and he told me to leave.

h55P31ql7npvguOLm0Yc8A,9U0FF69TOFifIe5YS5G8Pg,"Let's start this review by saying that when we are at that point, my girlfriend and I will be going to Jos. A. Bank for mine and my groomsman's suits.  Allow me to give you a numbered breakdown of the issues we encountered when renting from Men's Wearhouse to be the groomsmen in our friends wedding.

1- They never contacted us after the fitting after saying there would be a followup call.  The other groomsmen and I had to follow up repeatedly to get an answer as to when our tuxedos would arrive and the staff were very short with our honest questions over the phone.
2- They sent two of our tuxedos to Homestead when we asked for them to be sent to Ross Park Mall during the fitting.
3- When one of us called two days prior to the wedding to ask if our tux's had arrived the guy answering the phone said ""Oh... I don't know"" (insert an awkward, pregnant pause here while waiting for him to say ""Let me check that for you"") he instead said ""Well, I'm going to hang up now.""  And he made good on that promise, and hung up.
4- Despite saying we'd get a call a few weeks ahead of the wedding to be resized in case one of us gained a few lbs over the winter, this call never came so we basically had to hope that everything fit as it needed to.
5- We were at one point informed that MW had our emails on file and that when our tuxes arrived at the store we would receive an email letting us know.  Not a single groomsman received any such email to that effect.
6- One of the groomsmen randomly received a black tie while everybody else had white.  Another received no studs.  We discovered this approximately two hours to show-time while relatively far from civilization.
7- On picking up my tux I informed the associate ""I'll be unable to get to a Men's Wearhouse for a few days after the wedding, is this alright?"" to which she responded ""Yeah that should be fine"" so when my girlfriend graciously dropped off my tux for me a few days later and learned of the $100 late fee, I was totally caught off guard.
8- My girlfriend was also caught totally off guard by the associate at Ross Park Mall who was incredibly rude to her when  he informed her of said late fee.
9- As the Best Man I was given a coupon card for $50 off my next rental at Men's Wearhouse.  Since I am in another wedding next month with rentals from MW I figured this would be an opportune time to use it.  Imagine my shock while paying for the next weddings rental, when I presented the coupon and was told ""Oh, that isn't for this.  That is intended for YOUR wedding.  Oh and it expires on December 31st of this year."" 
10- The groom himself decided to use a coupon to purchase a suit for the wedding and to own, rather than rent a tux for the occasion.  He was ensured by the Homestead staff that the coupon would be fine for this purpose and got fitted for it.  When he went to pick up his suit and pay with the aid of said approved coupon he was instead forced into an argument with an associate who insisted he could not use the coupon towards the suit that an associate a few weeks earlier had insisted he could use.  Granted, now I am speaking for another person so take that with as much salt as you may, but he reiterated this fact to me several times prior to his wedding last week.

Over my friends wedding weekend, any time anything even went slightly wrong at and around his wedding, the joke between the Groom and his Groomsmen was ""Effing Men's Wearhouse.""  For example, at a restaurant, ""Wait I asked for no onions on this sandwich. - Effing Men's Wearhouse!""  ""Noise complaint at the hotel room? Men's Wearhouse.""

Another groomsman looked at me when we discovered the wrong color tie one of us received and said to me ""I hope you're taking notes for your own impending wedding"" to which I replied ""Perhaps I could find better service from GoodWill of Western PA""

Congrats Men's Wearhouse.  You became the butt of every joke for every mishap for an entire weekend around a wedding to which you provided the suits.

TL;DR - 10 mistakes, several rude associates and 1 future groom going to Jos. A. Bank.",1,DMy5IG-dNrH4ARk96KngEA,1,1,2014-06-20,review,1

ckLyJAIbb4Do-ymu8fwMQQ,egcP7Iyw0FhuF6QJYohooA,"Let me start out by saying that my husband loves the MW at Westmoreland Mall, and even rented his tux there for our wedding without issue. Last year, he also rented a tux there for an out-of-town wedding he was in. After the wedding was over (the next day, before we returned home), we returned the tux to a MW at the local mall, also sans any issues.

Recently, said husband got a promotion and bought some dress pants and shirts from MW at the mall, and was sent a $50 gift card. Last weekend, we decided to head down to The Waterfront....lo and behold, there's a MW in Homestead. Who knew? So, we head to MW to see if he can get something for free. Before we go in, I ask him, how much are pants normally at MW? He said, oh about $50 or $60. Okay, well the cheapest pair of pants we find are around $130, but most around $200?! I'm shocked, never thought men's dress clothes were so pricey. Again, who knew? Surprisingly, we were able to sift through the sale racks and were able to find one pair of pants on sale for $19.99 and dress shirts for $14.99! Very exciting! 

The problem was the staff and the store itself. First of all, the store was messy. Sales racks had clothes out of place and shirts rolled up, not a good impression for a 'high end' men's clothing store, not to mention it was hard to look for sizes etc. with everything out of place.

The biggest issue was with the staff. There were five employees in the store. Okay, I get it, they work on commission, but seriously. The one and only employee who approached us, and I can't remember her name but she was a middle-aged Russian woman- was a shark! She asked if we need help, we both say no, we're fine. Just looking. I am much more assertive than my husband, however, which she realized right away. Needless to say, she wouldn't leave us alone. I tried several times - nicely - to tell her we were just looking around. My husband said, I'm looking for some dress shirts and pants. maybe a tie. She just doesn't get it...keeps asking ""Do you want to look at more ties?"" ""We have nice blazers and jackets"" I'm finally like, lady we're only here because we have a gift card, we don't plan on spending a ton of money. Getting her to leave us alone was near impossible. If it would have been me alone, I would have walked out. However, I knew my husband wanted to use the gift card.

The worst part is there were other customers in the store that no one was waiting on. Some of which were looking around for assistance. I didn't get it.

Continuing on, check out was a nightmare! Each and every item rang up more than the price tag. She had to end up cancelling the sale and re-doing the whole thing. We had to carefully scrutinize every thing she rang up, to make sure we weren't overcharged. We ended up going over the $50 - obviously. So, she says, ""You can swipe your card there."" I said, ""We have cash"" and omg you would have thought it was the end of the world. They had no money in the drawer and she actually had to send another employee in the back to get us change. 

Let's just say, I'm sure my hub won't returning here anytime soon. You can buy nice men's clothing almost anywhere else for less money and less hassle.

My husband is a popular guy, in lots of weddings in the last couple years and he's an unusual size -- 44 Long. 

During the pickup just 3 short days ago at the Waterfront location - for which he was measured 16 weeks ago - I asked ""why is this thing like a trash bag on my handsome stud"", their response of ""oh sorry, nothing we can do about it"" was a complete lie. ""We can't alter rentals, sorry"". 

You see, on the return label I noticed the jacket was a 48L. 

Remember I said he's actually a 44Long?

Men's Wearhouse on of the Waterfront gave my husband a tux not one, but TWO FULL SIZES TOO LARGE. 

Future grooms -- rent your tux from a local provider. Or, better yet, send your groomsmen to a professional tailor to get measured for free. Then, order your tuxes online from Vietnam.

The hoagies are never soggy and this might seem like a small thing but they use shredded lettuce.  I hate when you go somewhere and it's just regular ripped off the head lettuce, not this place.  I do think it's a little expensive but I've watched the prices go up with the economy and their popularity so I'm sure it's justified.  

Side tip, go in and get a slice of Pizza, it's a little different than their whole pizzas you order.  It's really good.

The few times I have dined (if that's what you want to call it) at an E'nP I felt like committing Sepaku (Hari - Kiri). I never got sick from the food but more disgusted with myself for stooping to this level of gastronomy. Nothing really worthwhile on the menu (maybe a burger- how much can you mess that up?). My gut just tells me not to trust E 'N Ps.  No offense to truck drivers of America b/c they keep supplies on our selves but It  reminds me of a truck stop restaurant without the truck drivers. I always seem to migrate to the salad bar and get weirded out for having to deal with the utensils that pick up the salad. So I wind up washing my hands after getting my salad stuff. The waterfront  E 'N P is perhaps the cleanest one I have been to but that's not saying much b/c the patrons are kinda off. So an extra star for this location.

Chicken noodle soup

Pepsi

The hamburger is nothing special, but it tastes good, is not overcooked and has a good barbeque sauce with onions that are actually cooked.

Even worse, we noticed ants crawling all over the window sill next to us!

Half an hour later the server decides to ask ""You gettin' dessert?"" We ordered slices of pie to go. My ""slice"" of strawberry pie was two strawberries and a few crumbs of crust. We went up front to pay to find one lady at the register (who seemed to be the sole adult employee) counting her drawer and nobody else in sight. We stood there and evil eyed her for a few minutes and she finally took a break from her conversation to say someone would be with us.

My husband and I were craving a late night snack after seeing a movie a couple weekends ago and decided to try this Eat 'N Park location for the first time. I had always been adequately satisfied at other locations so I thought this restaurant would be worth a try.

I ordered several items - Sweet Potato Fries with Apple Butter Dip, Hot Chocolate, and Pumpkin Creme Pie. I think my husband ordered some sort of burger or sandwich. Anyway, every item was problematic in some way. The fries were good, but the apple butter was oddly thick and sweet. The hot chocolate had ""creative"" chocolate syrup drizzling, that was running all down the cup and saucer. I had to carefully drink the beverage - which was OK - because I was afraid that I would get the syrup all over my hand, face, and clothes. The pumpkin creme pie looked like it was sliced by a 5 year old. It looked like it had been carelessly cut and plopped onto the plate, where it appeared very flat and unappetizing.

However, our waitress was the sweetest, middle-aged woman! Our food took a little time to get to our table (not too bad though) and she comped two of the items (I believe the Hot Chocolate and the pie) from our bill. She was very attentive and kind while we dined there, and I made sure that my husband gave her a good tip. If I remembered her name, I would definitely mention it in this review.

I waited about 15 more minutes until the server came back to tell her my dish was lacking a primary ingredient.  She asked if I wanted some hot sauce on the side to put on myself, but it had taken so long to deliver and for her to return to our table that the macaroni was stone cold and no amount of hot sauce would have saved it.

There was a short 10 minute wait for a table at around noon but the hostess was nice enough and they gave us a big, clean booth with a partial view of the river. It took another 10-15 minutes to get service although our waiter did pop by to say he would be right with us. Another waitress took our order in the end and they comped us for one buffet. So the three of us ate for the price of one since kids five and under get a free buffet with a paying adult. ($7.99)

Ok enough about the service which was slowish but it's a full house at that time so understandable . The food:

The buffet was constantly refreshed and each container overflowing with hot food. My favorites: really well cooked fried chicken perfectly salted and complemented with Frank's red hot sauce. Biscuits and gravy, the biscuits were a little dry, mini peirogies, cooked baby carrots, really nice mini pancakes, stuffing, bacon, and ok-only home fries. It's too bad cos I generally judge a place by the quality of their breakfast potatoes but in this case the fried chicken more than made up for it. My husband had some decent salad and good clam chowda.

My kid ate everything on the other end of the buffet: cherry tomatoes, cottage cheese, cooked baby carrots, cantaloupe and honeydew melon, pineapple, bits of peirogie and chicken. The waiter gave him a shamrock sugar cookie at the end of the meal. We helped him eat most of it :)

There were a few misses: French toast were disappointingly dry and hard and the buttery/oniony noodles were undercooked. Other things looked good but we couldn't try it all: mini-waffles, mash potatoes and gravy, sausage patties, cheesey sauce, scrambled eggs. We'll just have to go again in a few weekends.

Get the less-than-half-cup of fruit and it's sub par. Yes, winter, but isn't their ideal to use what is in season? I can still find some sort of fruit in grocery store that's decent and you're a major chain! Find a supplier. What really was disappointing was that my server up-charged me 1.99 for less-than-half-cup. Now I have worked in the past for many years. Yes, some swaps do require an additional charge, but really? I just gave you back potatoes and toast for clear fruit. She did take it off, but I'm sure she was doing what is practice. So if I would have paid for that it would have been over 10 bucks for two eggs, two pieces of bacon (which is a buck a piece on up charge on friend's sandwich) and coffee and basically three bites of fruit.

c1lGyd-pE_0tLx7k8fr9zA,z-E3LeGzkAutcQZSRNLC4Q,"Possibly the worst dining experience I've had.  My husband and I were riding the bike trail in Pittsburgh and we decided to grab a bite to eat here since this location is right along the trail.  We noticed there were many tables open on the patio so we requested to sit outside.  It was rather busy inside so we waited patiently for 20 minutes until it was our turn to be seated.  The hostess then took us to a table inside the restaurant.  Not wanting to be rude, I asked if they were not putting anyone outside for some reason... She said the person who took our name didn't indicate that we wanted to sit outside (however, I watched her write ""patio"" next to our name).  We were then led outside and told to sit where ever we wanted... Because it was still basically empty... 

Finally happy to be seated, we waited another 10 minutes or so for our waitress to come.  She asked if we were ready to order both our meals and drinks so we did.  It took another 10 minutes to get our drinks which we quickly drank because we were thirsty from riding.  We were able to get a refill before we got our food since it took over 40 minutes from the time we ordered it.  The waitress came back one more time after we were done eating and I asked it I could talk to someone about how long everything took but she did not seem interested.  No apology.   Nothing.  She simply said that sometimes they aren't told when someone is seated outside.  Maybe that would explain the initial wait but why the terrible service after she clearly knew we were there?

This Eat'n Park is a joke.  Extremely slow service and a rude waitress on top of it.  The food was ok, but paying for that meal made me feel like I was being robbed.  A group of people at the table next to us walked out after waiting 10-15 minutes for a waitress to acknowledge them.  Even when a woman at the table asked our waitress if she could order drinks, she just went inside and ignored them.

From the second I walked in the door no one acknowledged my sister or myself for at least five to ten minutes, which I thought was weird because they were not busy. The manager, who was standing close and talking to another employee looked briefly at us, didn't smile or welcome us, turned and continued her conversation. We finally get sat at a booth that the hostess sloppily wiped off, left crumbs all over the seat and left old trash sitting on the table. We sat in the booth for ten minutes waiting for someone to come wait on us before I finally decided enough was enough and left. My sister loves Eat n Park but every time I enter the waterfront store I'm severely disappointed. 
 
I've been a manager and a cook at two very busy restaurants in Oakland for over six years so I know what I'm talking about.

Unfortunately, that was the high point of this service.  We sat there for 20 minutes without drinks, in fact some meals started coming out and we still didn't have our beverages.  Half the table had Pepsi or Diet Pepsi, the other half had water and two people had dr. pepper.  I'm not sure why they couldn't just get pitchers.....I got the salad bar only, it was ok but it was messy so when you went to add items other items were mixed in which is kind of gross, I thought the chili was overly salty.  The other people we were with didn't have much good to say about their meals, with the exception of the angus burger.  Janee did stop and take a picture of our whole table which was nice and we were there three hours so she did earn her pay, but she set the expectation high that she knew what she was doing and it fell flat pretty fast.  I'm not sure it was all her fault as she didn't seem to have a staff that was working to support her, just catch her up as needed.  I think if you have 20 people at a table 2-3 staff members would make you more successful.  When we went to leave I bought a dozen of the sugar cookies.  The person at the counter didn't know how to ring them up and was quite rude when I asked for her to ring them up, like I was doing her a disservice by asking to purchase the restaurant's products.

j3HImdofh_Fvb1ZVF2VwqQ,vY1YpzWpZ03olPRm8C4a2A,"Perhaps the crowd here is less harsh, because I feel like the location in Squirrel Hill has been consistently better despite having a slightly lower rating. I've only been here three times - twice on a Wednesday night around 5 and once on a Saturday at around noon. From looking at the other pictures, the food doesn't seem so bad, so I might have just been unlucky on the Wednesday evenings, because both times I've ordered, the food was completely unsatisfactory.

The first time, the sesame pork chop was tiny - definitely not worth nearly 10 dollars (I take SOME presentation into account as well, and the food just looked thrown together on the plate). But I had the great salad bar to make up for it, and managed to cram 6 plates of salad because I'm a college student trying to maximize my nutrient to price ratio. And on the plus side, the waiter, Kevin, was very friendly, and even comped my HUGE piece of pumpkin creme pie for no particular reason. I didn't mention anything about the pork chop because I was very satisfied with the salad bar, anyway.

The second time, I ordered the chicken broccoli alfredo, and it was absolutely disgusting. I could see oil droplets on the entire dish (and I understand that alfredo is a creamy, oily dish, but this was ridiculous), the chicken was slightly burnt, and there were THREE pieces of broccoli. In a dish called ""chicken and broccoli alfredo!"" Honestly, I've never sent back food because who knows how chefs would respond, but oh well. On the plus side, the waitress (Aly or Ally I think) was absolutely lovely. A lot of energy, smiles, and attentiveness, so of course, I tipped well.

The place was packed on Saturday at noon, but other than that I had no issues. I'm not sure who cuts the pies though (whether they're already sliced or the waiter/waitress does it quickly), because the carrot cake I had was considerably tinier than the pumpkin creme pie!

I like my fish broiled, their signature is too salty for my liking. Bread is mmmgood and hot (free). Staff is very  accommodating ie you can request to sample a soup and the servers are pleased to do so. I recommend you try their soups like the seafood gumbo.

The fish was fresh. My mom's chilean sea bass shanghi style came with sticky rice and spinach. The sea bass had nice texture and was reasonably priced.

We were both eating lite since a) I was dieting and b) my family was having dinner at my mother's house and she was slaving over lasagna all day, so if anyone knows anything about Italian mother's, you better arrive hungry. Back to mitchell's, I had the iceberg wedge with bacon, egg, tomatoes and a delicious home made blue cheese dressing. I also ordered a bowl of seafood gumbo which was the best gumbo I ever tasted. It wasn't overly packed with rice, as a matter of fact, there wasn't much rice at all. It was mostly shredded crab, scallops, and shrimp with a very delicate broth that wasn't too thick and the heat snuck up on you after swallowing. It wasn't a lot of heat, just enough to make it exciting. As for the iceberg wedge salad, every once in awhile I need a piece of iceberg instead of a bowl of spring mix (ie: tender weeds). The star of this salad was the chef made blue cheese dressing. It was not overly thick, very tasty and savory. It complimented the bacon and egg on the wedge. The cousin ordered the carrot cake for dessert and it was easily a pound slice. I tasted a little bite and must say it's the best carrot cake I've ever tasted. The cream cheese frosting was more buttery than ""cheesy"", it was a great surprise when you're expecting the normal cream cheese frosting. There were whole walnuts throughout the cake and many raisins, which I love. Also this recipe seems to rely on more cinnamon than I've tasted in the past. I highly recommend it. It was a wonderful lunch and I'm sure she had carrot cake to take on the plane ride back to Riverside.",0,usSROUMiAgPcxV3Ym0OxMQ,0,4,2010-09-16,review,2

yfRrC6MhxpIJ4-xMcrmk5Q,yzaMXmAL8xO-FVu092GtRA,"Mitchell's Fish Market is a very nice place to eat...for a chain restaurant.  And actually, if it wasn't a chain, it wouldn't be too bad either.  The atmosphere was surprisingly pleasant - the room was warm and intimate, perfect for a date.  It wasn't too noisy or too crowded, and we were seated right away on a Friday around 7:30 pm.

Our server was friendly, and happy to give recommendations.  I started with a house salad, which I told the server I would split with my boyfriend.  She brought it to us on two separate plates, which I thought was a nice touch, and more than what I expected.  Poppy seed dressing was okay, it's pretty thick and creamy as I remember, but tasty.

I ordered from the special menu, since they had a bit of a lobster promotion going on.  My entree was a combo: lobster tail, and ""lobster pot pie.""  Now, lobster is a beautiful thing, but I have to say....it wasn't beautiful here.  It wasn't awful, but it didn't taste as fresh as I like (I'm guessing that's because the meat was frozen originally).  It's just a shame.  Dipping the lobster in butter was a pleasant experience, but it's supposed to be an ecstatic one.

The lobster pot pie was totes not what I imagined.  I pictured a flaky, golden crust, a delicious creamy lobstery gravy, and big hunks of lobster and vegetables.  Instead....I got what sort of resembled a small bread bowl made of a biscuit.  There was a lot of sauce, which was surprisingly orange in color and very rich, with some lobster chunks and vegetables that appeared to come from a bag of frozen veg (I'd recognize those tiny square-shaped carrot chunks anywhere)!  Whaaaaaaaat?  It wasn't bad or anything, but not what I imagined.  I was a little bummed out.  

So everything we ate was just fine, and nice when you're craving seafood....but I think in future I'd rather just head to the Strip, get a lobster, and cook the sucker up myself.  I didn't try their fresh preparations, so I can't say how those were.

I'd say in the Waterfront though, it's probably one of your better options.  Healthier and fresher than most of the other choices.  And the atmosphere is great, including the service.",0,usSROUMiAgPcxV3Ym0OxMQ,0,3,2011-03-14,review,2

After biking on the river trail that led us to the Waterfront, we zoomed past what looked like a wonderful patio situation at Mitchell's, right on the river. We parked our bikes and were seated promptly at the patio. The waitress even filled our water bottles for us! The interior of the restaurant is very nice, sea-themed, and clean. The decor is really tasteful and classy. The outside was perfect. It was Sunday afternoon and the weather was gorgeous. Looking out to a serene part of the river is fabulous as well. Our waiter was professional, knowledgeable and friendly. We decided just on a few drinks and an app. The two drinks my bf ordered were AMAZING. The first, muddled basil, grapefruit juice and vodka (I forget the name). SO refreshing! the basil was flavorful and tasted awesome with the grapefruit juice. The second he got was a frothy pineapple-vodka with a huge fresh chunk of pineapple inside. Both were winners. I stuck with a fairly priced white wine but got to test his fun drinks :) The app we got was the Hawaiian Seared Ahi Tuna and it was delicious as well. It was a pretty decent size to split, and came with sushi rice, a red onion/cucumber relish, ginger and wasabi. I believe the tuna was also drizzled with ponzu. It was so good - definitely recommend! My bf couldn't help himself so he also ordered a cup of lobster bisque, which I don't eat, but he said it was very good. He also polished off some of the warm bread loaf that accompanied our meal. This place definitely earns the stars and I had no idea it was even a chain. The waiter said they were expanding, so hopefully the quality and service don't go down. I also checked out the rest of the menu and they use quality ingredients and the prices really aren't bad (it was the lunch menu - I'm sure the dinner menu is pricier.)

APPETIZERS: Cup of Maine Lobster Bisque for me -- soo good! My fiance had the New Orleans Seafood Gumbo which I had a taste of it and it was good, but I liked my soup better...very rich and creamy but full of flavor with a fair amount of lobster bits mixed in. The bread they served with the apps was fresh baked (I believe sourdough) and it was quite tasty along with the whipped butter. Our entrees came with house salads - had great elements, but I felt I couldn't enjoy mine because the dressing given was a poppyseed vinagrette and I can't handle too much acidity in my food these days. My fiance however cleaned his salad plate (not a sentence I utter often).
ENTREES: I had one of the specials, Grilled Shrimp and Scallops with roasted summer vegetables and tomato vinagrette (which I asked for on the side). The seafood part was great - the vegetables were so-so. My fiance had the special of Cod stuffed with Lobster (and some other seafood) with asparagus and a lemony sauce - I had a taste of his and it was really yummy, I'll def order that next time! We both finished our plates, which wasn't too challenging b/c the portions were moderate (I got 3  srhimp and 3 scallops for example) but still filling.

I was highly disappointed in the service, and I only ordered take out.    Upon going to the bar to announce that I was there for take out, there were 3 other people at the bar.   The bartender had her back to me and it wasn't until a few minutes had passed that another guest told her that she should wait on me.    

After announcing the reason for my visit, she checks on my order (not ready yet) and helps other tables.  No offer of water, or a drink.  Another gentleman working the bar asked the bartender if she had offered me a drink, she stated to him my order would be right up.   He then asked if she offered me a water, to which she replied, her order is going to be right up.    He placed a glass of water in front of me.

Then I hear my name and order announced by the kitchen staff.   3 staff members yelled. .  .""it's TAKEOUT""  so back it went into the kitchen to be packed up.

Gentelman bartender asks female bartender if she has rung me up yet (she had not)

After more time had passed (how long does it take to put food into a takeout container?)   it finally is put down in front of me.  She then rings me up.   I don't expect take out to be piping hot, but at this point i wondered if it was even going to be room.

That being said, I came here and was delighted by my server Michael who was not only friendly but incredibly attentive and very sharp. 
I originally ordered the Mahi Mahi but alas, the ran out upon my ordering, in which case the manager promptly came to ask me for another upgraded selection at no additional charge. Hence, the tuna. 
Now the tuna was amazing. Seared almost perfectly, with the rare flavor still intact.

They do take reservations, but doubtful you need one on a weekday during lunch.  It wasn't busy when I was there on a Tuesday at noon.

Mitchell's has a cool layout - large full bar in the middle, private large rooms for large parties, smaller areas for business lunches, full dining room seating with tables and booths, and an excellent outdoor patio where you can watch people ride by on the bike trail.  

This is a seafood restaurant with lots of good options for fresh in season fish.  You can choose from a number of different fish to have prepared for salads, sandwiches, or just as they are.  I had the chopped salad and added scallops to it.  Delicious!  

The price range is reasonable and you can plan on spending around $15 with your lunch and a soda/iced tea.  For that price, you really can't complain.  I drop almost that much at Panera on a half sandwich and cup of soup with an iced tea.  

I'm sure it's much busier for dinner but I find Mitchell's to be an excellent place for a business lunch or just meeting friends.  I've been here for brunch as well and had an excellent Bloody Mary and eggs benedict with crab.",0,usSROUMiAgPcxV3Ym0OxMQ,0,4,2014-07-22,review,1

Service. I was there with a large group for a meeting. They gave us a private room and two servers took care of us. They were efficient and very accommodating. Kudos. 

Appetizers: had the crab dip and calamari. Both were good. Servers brought extra chips with the dip as they were needed. I'm always surprised that more chips are not just added to the original dish at this point. Dip was good. Calamari was done well. Preferred the shrimp cocktail Sauce with it versus the Asian type soy sauce that is served with it. 

Wedge salad with bleu cheese. Waaaaaay too much cheese and I like bleu cheese. 

I had the blackened tuna with mashed potatoes and seasonal veggies. Carrots were carrot sticks hardly cooked and dry! Green beans overdone and broccoli had seen better days. Simple green beans would have been more appetizing. 
Tuna had blackening spices but needed a better sear on it. Was not over cooked. Potatoes as expected. 
Other dishes seen--fisherman's platter. Looked a little greasy, but that's expected from me in a full fried dish. Would be nice if this was offered broiled as well. Crab cakes and filet looked okay. 

Overall I'm always underwhelmed and overcharged here. I guess with chain places you get that, but I want more from a place that charges me 25 bucks for sub-seared tuna.",0,usSROUMiAgPcxV3Ym0OxMQ,0,3,2014-11-22,review,0

I also had blacken salmon with a double order of spinach instead of a starch. The spinach was just steamed without any flavoring... Which is better in the long run,  but I wish they had options for sauteed with garlic.

There's a lot to like about this Columbus OH based chain.  I don't usually eat at chain restaurants nor will I review them because they're typically big food corporate run places that don't care what they feed you they just care about their stockholders.  This place seems different to me.  The food quality and care seems to be very high.  

The staff is always well trained.  I like the decor and ambiance.  The menu offers many options.  I don't really like the fish preparation options very much and the portions can be small in some of the dishes but overall I am a fan.  I do really appreciate being able to buy fresh fish here.  I like to buy the trout and prepare it at home.

I ordered the chowder and the crab cakes. The chowder was basically flour stew with potatoes. I'm guessing that there may have been a clam or two in there somewhere, but you couldn't taste it if there was through the flour. 

The crab cakes were definitely frozen, and not made from blue crab. If you're going to offer Chesapeake crab cakes, they had damn well better be the real deal. Zero flavor and dry as hell. Stringy, Asian crab that was definitely pre-made. Terrible.

     food---  my friend had a ceasar salad:  the staff didn't know where the anchovies were, therefore none.  it was served at room temperature.  chef's special was penne in a light alfredo sauce with crab and shrimp.  it also was served at room temperature.  i had the scallops with stir fried vegetables.  the scallops, too, were at room temperature and only seared on one side, some not at all.  the manager offered to redo the meals, which we accepted.  she shrugged her shoulders and said she didn't know what else she could do.  the scallops were better the 2nd time, penne was watery, crab was all but invisible.  the garnish had cheese on it the first time, not the 2nd.  penne was mediocre at best.
     service--- probably the worst service i've ever had there.  our server seemed overwhelmed, apologized continually to us and every other table she had nearby.  maybe that was part of the reason our meals were not hot the first time.  never did get a refill on iced tea.
     ambiance--- the place is starting to look tired.  the tables are showing their age.... the surface hasn't been kept up, the finish has long since worn off in the most used parts.

sorry to see this place go down hill.  have many memories of better times.  may not ever go back.  looking for a new place in the area.",0,usSROUMiAgPcxV3Ym0OxMQ,0,2,2015-06-07,review,0

1) Waitress (Angela) could not be found for 10+ minutes at a time. The entire meal was a running commentary on where she was and why we didn't even get water refills until dinner came. She had to be specifically asked three times for water before we got our one and only refill.

2) Spilled mussel butter on my jacket and although she did apologize no manager ever came over to see if we were okay. When I did complain they offered a $25 gift card which didn't even cover the cost of said jacket, thanks but no thanks.

3) When asked specifically if a dessert was served warm the waitress said ""yes, of course"" but spoiler alert it wasn't. Party involved said it was fine and asked me not to say something.

4) When asked if they had a very specific after dessert drink the waitress replied in the affirmative only to substitute Irish coffee instead. If you are out of something just own up to it, don't try to pull one over on someone.

Long story short - decent if overpriced food, nonexistent management and the worst service I have experienced in a long while. As a server myself I am pretty forgiving but the (non)service ruined a $150 meal and Mitchell's management couldn't care less.",0,usSROUMiAgPcxV3Ym0OxMQ,0,2,2015-06-20,review,4

We were seated in a picture perfect spot by the window as requested. Our waiter initially greeted us warmly but the service went south quickly and I trying to wrap my head around - Why?  
What was wrong with the service you wondered. Well.....
*We had to wait a long time for our drinks 
*appetizers ordered but not received.
* Requested bread several times waiter was oblivious to the request 
* Dinner took for ever it felt like a century later
 It was good thing we was on vacation so we had time to waste. 
We observed the other waiters and waitress was busy attending to their patrons. 
On the plus side the food was divinely delicious!  Salmon, scallops- Super fresh and melted in my mouth.  My husband's dish ordered the Shrimp and Crab Cakes and he hummed  yum to every bite he ate.

The patio area is great when the weather is nice and I've historically loved the fish preparations.   This last trip, though, was a pretty steep slide downhill.  

First, I went to the bar and ordered a glass of the house pinot grigio...a generous poor from a bottle that was definitely a couple days past its prime.   You should know better.   

Then onto the table.  I'm pretty sure the hostess double sat the server who was supposed to take care of me, because she expressed her frustration right in the middle of the patio area.  I waiting a few minutes and then someone else ended up taking care of me.   The service was fine, but I was a little put off by the start.  What really got me though was the menu.  Mitchell's used to have a great menu and I've always been thrilled with my selections.  I don't know what changed, but it was something.  I ordered the crispy ginger salmon with stir fried vegetables.   The portion was ample, but the fish was sort of mushy and the crispy ginger topping wasn't crispy at all.

The clam chowder was perfect; definitely get it. The mussels were delicious--not as firm as mussels usually are (but in a good way) and bigger than normal. The spicy crispy shrimp surprised me; I didn't think it would be good, but it was. Boyfriend said his lobster bisque was ""funky"" and I agreed that it tasted weird, but it was still edible. 

The calamari, however, was unseasoned. Maybe they forgot to season it that night? I feel like the way it was served to us is not the way they usually serve it. Also, I was disappointed with the small portion of the calamari. For $12, we should be getting way more than we did. 

Our server was attentive and noticed that we liked a lot of their appetizers, so she informed us about their happy hour (Monday through Friday 4:30-6:30pm) where their appetizers are at most $7 each! Tempting, especially after our pleasant dinner experience.

Lackluster, no, not really...Mediocre...no....Pedestrian/average/common...huh uh. Just 'eh.' It wasn't awful, terrible or even bad, and it wasn't great, good or even fine. It was just....edible, I guess.  
We started with shrimp dumplings from the happy hour menu and the BF got seafood gumbo. I thought the gumbo was decent; he said 'eh', however we both agreed the dumplings were 'eh'. 
I got something called the market trio, which came with creole style rice, corn, a crab cake, a hunk of salmon and 5 shrimp. It wasn't terrible, inedible food, it was just....not good. And for $28 I wish I would have just gotten a bowl of the gumbo. The only thing that seemed to have any flavor was the rice. The BF got a crab and lobster stuffed cod, which again, was not bad just not good. It had a lemony-buttery sauce, that didn't taste quite lemony or buttery somehow. 
I know this is a stupid thing to gripe about, but I hatehatehate when restaurants charge necessarily high prices for pop. Soda, cola, pop, call it what you want, but it should never be more than $2.50. I usually just drink water with lemon, but I had a headache, so I ordered a coke. $325!! And having a BF who works for a restaurant, I know that pop costs them pennies! I see $2-2.50; some people drink glass after glass of the stuff, but $3.25 is simply ridiculous. Especially when the food kinda sucks. And I read other reviews and the decor is not classy. It's like it's trying to be classy, but real classy restaurants know its' not classy.

I have been there before but is has been several years and really didn't recall much.  But like my friend I love seafood so there was no objections there.

The menu isn't too big, which is good, and they allow you to choose sides vs giving you what they deem you should have with your meal.  Our waitress was very nice. We arrived a little after my friend, but waited about 15 minutes for her other friend and date to show.  Once settled in we all placed our orders.

I decided on a yellowfin tuna, prepared medium rare, and for the sides I requested a double order of asparagus.  We didn't wait too long for our 6 meals to arrive.  However, 3 out of 6 of those contained mistakes.  My BFF asked for coleslaw.  Not there.  Easy fix they brought it out.  My husband wanted fries, he got potatoes.  Ok so now he gets both for same price, so I guess another easy fix.  And then there was me.  They just straight up brought me someone else's food.  The waitress quickly grabbed it up after I said to the guy this isn't what I ordered.  There was rice on the plate, and I don't know what fish since it only sat in front of me for a few seconds before being snatched away.  I only waited a few minutes and she brought me my correct meal.

The yellowfin looked amazing.  Nice thick portion, and once I cut into it, it was beautifully cooked and seasoned well.  However, my ""double"" order of asparagus was FIVE spears.  Before the waitress left after bringing the correct order I said something to her about it.  That to which she said, ""That is a double"".  Hmmm.  So a single order is 2 and  1/2 pieces of asparagus right?  That's bunk.  My fellow diners felt sorry for me and offered up some of their veggies, very sweet of them.  Weird thing was, my friend's other friends date ordered asparagus as one of his sides and got 4 pieces.  So was it just me or maybe they need some help executing in the kitchen and in service.  Not to mention the meal was $32.00, and I just bought a bundle of asparagus for 1.88 at the Giant Eagle!  

So other than the mix-ups and the asparagus situation of 2016, I really enjoyed my meal and time at Mitchells.  The fish was as noted very tasty, but the price is reflective of a special occasion dinner option.",18,usSROUMiAgPcxV3Ym0OxMQ,10,4,2016-03-24,review,20

We had remembered Mitchell's Fish Market as excellent for seafood, as well as (surprisingly) steak. Wow, were we disappointed!!!!!  The near-empty parking lot at 8:00 PM on a Friday was the first clue. The misunderstandings about the reservation and being treated accusingly by the front greeters who were arguing with each other was the second clue.  The lack of availability of the first 3 choices we made from the menu was the third clue.  The shoe really dropped when the food came.

Gave it 2 stars cause the wait staff was nice.   Was there on a Saturday night.  It was warm in there (too uncomfortable to enjoy a meal) and was told by management that air conditioning unit was broken.  Can't you afford to pay extra on a weekend to have someone repair or replace the unit?  Not even a ceiling fan in sight.  

Same old menu with few options.  Ordered the tuna medium and came out rare.  They redid it but this time was way overcooked.  Ate it anyway.  Are the chefs so inexperienced that they can't tell when something is rare, medium, or well done?

Outside of their current product, I was impressed by the size of the store, which seems a bit larger than average. Though it is a lot of square footage to cover, I was not impressed by their sales floor customer service. Yes, it's Old Navy, but I shopped in this store three times over the past week and did not have anyone come up to me while wandering around the outerwear. However, the woman that assisted me in the fitting room had a great attitude, and I really enjoyed interacting with her.

However, this was the not my experience yesterday. I drug my husband along, so I could look for new jeans and maybe find some sweaters / winter clothes on sale. 

There were signs up exclusively for Old Navy credit card users, which I am not. However, the 'sale' of buy two, get one free on thermals ended on January 7th (two days prior). Then, there was regular sign that simply stated 'buy two, get one free'. I was confused as to whether this applied to everyone, or just O. N. card users. So, I find an employee (the only one on the floor...) and she says that the sale applies to everyone, that the one for credit card holders is 'old'. Well, take it down, right?!

At checkout, there are cashiers, both waiting on one customer, no one else in line. The male cashier does not have his light on, so I opt for the other lane. There is a cashier, a woman, and what appears to be a manager, a younger woman. There is some issue regarding the patron's purchase. From what I can figure she opened up an O. N. card and was supposed to get a discount, but it didn't come off her total. 

My husband and I stood in line for several minutes. No one even looked at us...not even to say 'sorry, be right with you'...something. No acknowledgement whatsoever. Me, already being cursed with an impatient personality, gather my items and move to the other register after about five minutes. I ask the male cashier if he can ring me up. He says that he can, when he's done with the current customer. (duh...) I say, 'great, thanks, I wasn't sure since you're light isn't on.' To which he just shrugs. Ummm....

Needless to say, not the best of experiences this time. Just hoping that maybe some college kids called off or something and that they were understaffed. Will return, but not for the customer service....",0,qfL7ZFkxqDZOPIaVVfT3Aw,0,3,2015-01-10,review,0

The produce was similar to what you'd see in California this time of year, maybe a touch more limited. Also, it was holiday season, so all the junk that's associated with that too. 

The obvious differences were no alcohol section at all -  you can wander down the strip mall to the ""Beer"" store and buy mostly only in 24 packs. Apparently some of the Giant Eagles sell six packs, but not this one.  Also for people from out of state, check out the pierogi section, and the chipped ham, and other Pittsburgh oddities.

The whole point of going to McDonald's is indulging in some not-good-for-you food on the go in your busy life. In my case, I just wanted a small meal/snack that wouldn't cost me as much as the stuff in Kennywood would. I hadn't even eaten at a McDonald's in about eight years or so.

I waited thinking she was printing a receipt - nope! Eventually - after whipping out her phone and sending a text or two - she realized I was still there and told me to go to the next window for my food. Whatever, I figured, forget the receipt; by then I was pretty sure she had moved on to other orders and couldn't print my receipt anyway.

LhgQq1x4n9ardg1PFo8vgg,2XuIpV9mGhR6OQQkjsSt1g,"This is the best bike store I've walked into.  Their primary focus is on racing bikes, but (as I'm not a racer) the service stays top notch in much lower price ranges.

Got greeted by the staff, and my girlfriend and I got the luxury of absolutely no pressure as we walked around and looked at bikes.  She explained what she was looking for, and the staff explained what they had and what price range she was looking at.  I wound up talking to another person working there, and let them try to find a bike that fit.  (I'm 6'8"", and as I found out, fit pretty well on an XXL Scott 65cm frame.)

Anyways, back to my girlfriend's experience.  What impressed me was after they had a bike they thought was a winner, they let her go on a test ride around the neighborhood there.  And then when she came back in two minutes, told her that wasn't ideal, and sent her back out, with instructions to take the second left and try it on a hill.  After she figured out yes, that was the bike, the guy spent at least half an hour fitting the bike to her; he wound up switching out the stem, adding a seat with a little more travel, and getting everything just so.  There was no hurry.  There was no pressure.

The amount of interest that the staff showed in getting each person the just-so fit gets five stars; if you want a bike that fits, it's worth it to browse here.

And, update: I went out the other day, and asked for a price on a bike costing about 25% of the bike I tooled around on there two weeks ago.  Without batting an eye, and without a hint of bike snobbery, the owner ran off to figure out what it'd cost me.  I talked to him about the differences between a double and triple, and he spent twenty minutes explaining the pros and cons, and gave a strong suggestion on the double.  

That said, the price he quoted me was also 10% under the price quoted by another shop on the same exact bike.  I asked for the price of an upgrade to a single part on the new bike, and he quoted me about half the price I expected from doing research on the internet.  

Customer-friendly, well priced, super-high-quality bicycles.  A+++.


Edit, 4 years later: 

Glen, Beth, and the rest of the crew here are still there, and still awesome.  My girlfriend is now my wife.  My lowend Trek road bike now has more miles on it.  :-)

I have been shopping around for a couple months for a new road bike (which was going to be my first road bike ever, meaning that I'm fairly clueless about how to pick one out).  Also, since I'm a student, I don't have particularly deep pockets.

At Big Bang, I was greeted basically the moment I walked in the door.  I'm kind of shy when I know that I don't really know what I'm doing, but I wasn't pressured or harassed in any way by the staff.  Even though my price range was pretty low, they still tried their hardest to find a bike that suited my needs, and they found a bike that fitted me perfectly (and gave me an *excellent* deal on the price).  They take a lot of care to make sure you're properly fitted to the bike.

Also, this is one of the few bike stores I've been to where test riding is gleefully encouraged, rather than grudgingly allowed.  Definitely it's the only bike store where they'll tell you ""You haven't tried it out enough, go climb up the hill on  it!"" -- they definitely put the emphasis on matching rider with bike, rather than making a quick sale.

I would definitely recommend this place to anyone who's looking for a road bike, whether they're a seasoned racer or a neophyte rider like me.",0,4ykgzzzGEWjMD5lwk1-l9A,0,5,2009-04-27,review,0

7DeM4C66zVflYNrZn_Vv9g,IGMZPIts_kOCAetgJMvMIA,"When I think BBB... I think the days of simply bringing your bike in for a quick and relatively inexpensive tune-up and a few fixes are long gone.    

This review is more for the repair end of BBB. In their defense BBB does appear to carry some amazing brands of bike (ie Colnago) that you just don't find anywhere else in Pittsburgh. 

At BBB I was charged $250 for a tune up and a few other things. Granted this included installing a sew up tire (which I can understand would cost approx $50), Swapping out a left side (big ring) shifter on my down tube (this should have cost approx. $20 at most) and installing new bar tape (cost of tape $20 and $20 to install?).. SO WHAT""S WITH $140 FOR A TUNE UP? Well the story goes like this:

I bring the bike into BBB prior to the nice weather hitting Pittsburgh in hopes of trying what people have said is a great bike shop and getting my OCLV TREK 5900 ready for the season. Turns out I don't hear from these guys. A week goes by ...two weeks...I think that's ok I have two or three other bike I can turn to for a ride. Then I wind up going out of town for a week thinking for sure I'll get a call from them re: my bike is ready to roll...but no dice. So I call. Turns out a screw snapped when the mechanic was re-installing the down tube shifter and it had to be tapped out (is that my fault?). He says ""Should be ready in a few days"". So I come in a few days later to this mammoth bill. I ask if I am paying for the labor of taping out the screw? I don't think I ever got a straight answer? I look at the bill and can't see a good breakdown of the charges. Normally I would ""duke it over"" a bill like this but I figured...I had somewhere I to be 10 minutes ago and at least I finally have my bike. I would expect that for that money my bike could have been stripped down to the frame and totally gone over (overhauled). But it wasn't.  Well BBB I'll give you a star because the mechanic did do a good job in that my cycle shifts well and the tape job on the bars looks great (nice wrap). Plus I'll toss in a star for your outstanding selection of high end cycles. Maybe I would have rated BBB higher if I was in the market for a purchase instead of a simple repair?",0,4ykgzzzGEWjMD5lwk1-l9A,0,2,2009-06-09,review,1
SVd6Re9tpabo413b4LghYw,B_Lj8yhmdSJv2tB5ZHUTuw,"I wrote this review right after I had bought my bike.  I would like to update to reflect further experiences I've had with BBB.

So, first of all, one of the shifters on my bike turned out to be defective (not super-unusual for the Shimano short-reach shifters, also totally not the shop's fault -- these things happen).  Since it was covered under warranty, BBB switched it out for a new set of shifters, at no cost to me.  I had my bike back in a couple days, no muss no fuss.

My husband got a used road bike from Craigslist, and we brought it in for a tuneup.  The bike had several things wrong with it, due to a shoddy assembly job, and BBB basically took the entire bike apart and rebuilt it, cleaning it and replacing various worn-out bits.  I can't remember the total cost of this, but it was under $100.

I would totally recommend BBB, due to their general awesomeness.  I haven't had any of the tuneup-related woes that other people have had with this shop, even when bringing in a bike that I haven't bought there.",1,4ykgzzzGEWjMD5lwk1-l9A,0,5,2009-10-04,review,1

This is by far the premier shop in all of western PA, and arguably the state. 

Glenn the shop owner is one of the most knowledgeable men in the U.S. when it comes to cycling.  Having spent time in Europe, and with some of the biggest names in the industry, he truly knows what he's talking about.

Furthermore; he's a pleasure to talk to, incredibly friendly and passionate as anything about the sport.  As for bike fitting, this is the only shop I would go to, Glenn's knowledge and background can't be competed with, and he is incredibly thorough.

Yes, they equipment is expensive, but that's a result of the quality they carry..not them setting prices high. Cycling is expensive, end of story.

I would encourage getting fitted and even buying a bike there, but going back for service is a whole different story.  Same day service is unheard of here, even for the simplest of adjustments, no service is available at all on the weekends.  the first time I took a bike there to have a rear derailer hanger replaced and re-adjusted (I had already purchased and had the hanger) 11 days went by before I returned to pick my bike up after not being called.  I figured it was just a fluke experience and gave them the benefit of the doubt.  The second time. I took a bike in to have a damaged shift lever replaced with a new 7800 pair. I called after 9 days and they said it wold be 2 days more.  when I showed up 2 days later it still wasn't done, it took 2 more following that, 13 days total.

At no point did he try to upsell anything (in fact, he didn't even ask me about a budget). He just gave me a few things to think about before I invest in something new.

The crust is on the thin side and ever so crisp on the bottom, while still having enough dough on the edge to provide a nice chewy bit at the end of your slice. The dough itself is flavorful, not too... well, doughy. The sauce is great, and they don't drown the pizza in it. There's just enough cheese; not so much it's an overwhelming grease slick and not so little you can't tell it's there. If you can go while Mama's working, all the better.

You can eat in here; they have four or five booths and generations worth of family photos on the walls. Two of us split a small (8-cut) pizza with one topping ($9) and with our two cans of pop we were out for $10. You can't beat that. And I'd put Bellisario's pizza up against any in the city.

I grew up a five minute walk away. My mom loved Bellisario's and I have a lot of fond memories of walking through the alley to pick up a cheese pizza to bring home, my mom being too dollar-conscious to pay for delivery when there were perfectly able-bodied children around to go pick it up. Every time I have a slice, it brings back great memories. But I've had outside confirmation that it really is as awesome as I think it is.

It's a little divey, stuck in the back of an old shopping plaza, but it's perfect. If you're in West Mifflin (say, going to Kennywood), drive over and eat a pizza.

NdkFQP7J0KjG9g41t1v_uQ,ki00VmejY2SEXr7pqH5Saw,"Love butter? Then get thee to Pierogies Plus.

I live in St. Louis, and it seems like the only pierogi I can find are in my grocer's freezer. Oh, but when I go home to Pittsburgh, I can have as much of the chewy, flavorful, buttery goodness as I desire from Pierogies Plus.

The place still looks like an old service station with a tiny building and a roof over an old gas pump island. Inside, though, magical elves... uh... I mean fabulous Polish women... create deliciousness with love -- and butter. Have I mentioned that butter is a part of the deal? Because it totally is. You really should fast for two days before picking up pierogi from here.

Oh, but you'll be happy you did. I'm vegetarian, so I only order meat-free pierogi. I'm in love with the saurkraut and the cheese varieties. When you pick up a hot order, you'll get your pierogi covered in with rich butter and sauteed onions. No, I'm serious -- the pierogi are SWIMMING in butter. It's the best thing ever. Everything is packed inside a styrofoam container and a plastic bag, because butter WILL spill out.

You also can order cold or frozen pierogi if you plan to, say, lug them to the middle of the country to enjoy in a far-off city.

Besides many varieties of pierogi, you also can get things from the deli cases. Last time, I had some apricot blintzes, a latke and some type of apple turnover thingy. I really hope Pierogies Plus has the blintzes when I visit next.

Awesome thing: Pierogies Plus usually has coupons in the Entertainment Book. My best friend and I steal all of the coupons from our families so that I can get a steady stream of discounted Polish goodness each time I visit.

The only downside is that Pierogies Plus often closes for several days around holidays. I totally understand it -- family time is important! -- but that often coincides with my visits (I head east around the holidays mainly because I get an extra day with the fam without having to take another vacation day). I've learned to plan my trips around the Pierogies Plus schedule, though, because I MUST have yummy goodness.

Q9n_RbF8px9R0GL6xfyWbQ,sxjksyeVSrlwPozy0bZTwA,"I was planning to attend a conference in Pittsburgh and was researching food joints that I wanted to check out. A friend of mine insisted that I go to Pierogies Plus telling me that the food was so good that ever since he went that he has had pierogies mail-ordered to his house each year. While I have never been a huge fan of pierogies, I figured that I should heed my friends advice since he generally steers me to places I enjoy. Let's just say in this case, he hit the ball out of the park.

I actually wound up going to Pierogies Plus straight from the airport. After getting in a rental car and plugging in my GPS, imagine my surprise when my GPS announced ""You have reached your destination."" and I found myself sitting outside what appeared to be an old service station. When I walked inside and up to the counter, I found a crew of Polish women rocking out every kind of Pierogi imaginable. I was overwhelmed by the sheer volume of choices.

Wanting to try everything, I wound up going with their Sampler Platter #1 which was a small haluski (a noodle and cabbage mixture), a stuffed cabbage, and four pierogi ( I wound up going with a potato with bacon, potato with cheese, potato with jalapeno, and potato with meat). The food was outrageously good. I'm actually salivating just thinking back on the meal. The stuffed cabbage was not marred by the typical dryness that can afflict that dish and was perfectly sauced. The haluski, a dish I had never heard of, was amazing.

While I can't expect everyone to make their way to Pittsburgh solely to go to Pierogies Plus, do yourself a favor and order some. Those wonderful ladies deserve your business. Your belly will appreciate it!",0,LiMXTPwanF3LkkKHklFCjw,0,4,2011-03-22,review,3

While in line I met folks from Rhode Island, Kentucky, and North Carolina, who all had come to McKees Rocks in their rental cars straight from the airport before even going to see their families - that is dedication and commitment to some seriously delicious pierogies.

zWli0lD5TNKpTSHjXWdHxA,QBh1BuRkGYuZhzXzw-pMyw,"My coworkers and I left our office in Crafton, headed for Pierogies Plus. The journey there took us past bizarre, abandoned-looking buildings, and roads that suddenly ended in cement blockades. The area is prime for use as the setting of a slasher flick. 

BUT, the weird drive is totally worth it. Pierogies Plus is so legit. 

The setting is reminiscent of Seinfeld's 'Soup Nazi': tiny interior, people standing in line shoulder-to-shoulder, and a lady behind the counter brusquely taking orders. Oh, and make sure you order your 'rogies ""hot"" if you're planning on eating them soon! Otherwise, you get 'em frozen. (There's a slight up-charge for the hot ones, btw -- electricity ain't free!) 

They were out of the plain potato and the potato and cheese varieties when we were there, so I had the platter with pierogies and kielbasa. I opted for the sauerkraut pierogies, and they were SO good! The interior was filled with sauerkraut mixed with potatoes, as opposed to many other sauerkraut pierogies I've had that were filled with only kraut. I definitely prefer the potato/kraut mix! They were also drowning in butter and onions. Like, serious, serious butter - Paula Deen has nothin' on these ladies' butter usage. The kielbasa was awesome, too! I also sampled their haluski and it was the best I've ever had. Tons o' butter, seasoned with generous amounts of salt 'n' pepper, and there was quite a bit of sautéed onions in the mix, which added even more flavor. 

A few things to note: They have coupons you can print out on their website, but you must cut them out if you're gonna bring 'em in and use them! You cannot just hand them the whole piece of paper. If you want to order a special variety, they need 2 days advance notice (check their site to see what the 'special' ones are). They do accept credit cards, with a $10 min. Yes, some of the ladies are not the friendliest, but the food is so good, they can be like that, and you'll still come back for more!  And, parking is quite limited there. Pretty sure the building is a converted service station. :)

The seating room is accommodation, the service prompt and courteous.The prices are fantastic and so is the food.

I had a grilled hodge podge combination of hot/sweet sausage, potatoes, eggs, and peppers all on one dish for 9.50. It was excellent. Ladies and Gents, I can put food away  like a champ and I still had leftovers.

My friend had a succulent, buttery French Toast. Simple, but they nailed it.

9Ify25DK87s5_u2EhK0_Rg,JqZK87MaXF_81JAuLNSO2Q,"On a random Sunday morning I went in search of a good breakfast spot.  I decided to explore the McKees Rocks neighborhood and came upon Marge's Place.  I hadn't heard much about this place, but after reading the few reviews I could find, I decided to give it a try.  

Inside, it's bigger than I expected but still has that down home diner feel.  My guess is that most of the people there were regulars.  The wait staff was friendly to those they knew but also welcoming to me, someone they had never seen before.  I picked a table in the corner so I could observe what I imagine was a typical Sunday morning.  I ordered the breakfast special: 2 scrambled eggs with bacon, potatoes and toast.  Any place that has Mancini's Italian toast already gets thumbs up in my book.  Being in McKees Rocks, though, they really don't have a choice.  The potatoes were thin sliced with onions and very flavorful.  The only way I can think of to describe the bacon is...porkier.  Is that even a word?  I just don't know how else to descibe it.  The combination of foods was served in generous portions at a great price (under $5).  

One random note: I liked the tables and chairs.  They were comfortable not just for sitting and enjoying a cup of coffee with my morning paper but also very comfortable for sitting and eating.  Good distance between the table and chairs.  That may sound silly, and I thought so, too, at first.  But when I go to a place and the booth is too wide or too narrow, it can hinder my enjoyment.  

Not only will I return, but I will also recommend Marge's Place to anyone in the area.  It was a surprisingly good find.  I like places like neighborhood businesses like this where they make everyone feel like they belong.",1,r8BwdblCW-ZUES37BL0khw,0,5,2012-03-13,review,2

$19.18, seemed a little expensive compared to prices on Mt Wash, where this would have been $14-$16, no mas. (-1)
The delivery occurred ahead of the stated 45 minute time, delivery guy was great.
 The dough was a little tough, in fact my jaw hurt after 2 slices. I tried another piece about a half hour later and it was really tasty and the crust was a bit softer. I also like the ""Dirty Crust"" (+1), they flip the crust down to size covering a presauced section, putting a small bit of sauce inside the crust.

They have another option when you come at other times for a 2 party sharing meal which is listed on the menu.

The lady let me pick out the vase urn along with the Styrofoam that will hold the arrangement. I was able to find various spring flowers reduced at half price which I thought would make a nice arrangement. She told me that they will make it for me if I would give them a couple of days. I was okay with that since I wasn't in any hurry. They also sell ribbon which either they or you if you have the skill can make into those giant bows that go around the base to make it look pretty.

The store is very reasonably priced and good if you are into making your own crafts. They did tell me that they make these grave vases all year so I can come back anytime to arrange for another spray to be made.

This store is located at the entrance of McKees Rocks in the site of the former Foodland. My daughter who had just graduated college with a degree in art found the store very interesting for some of the skills she uses. They are also online if you want to look for sales.",3,wAMQZpei99cEvJz9EeppSQ,1,3,2016-05-25,review,5

The one I shop has a small Market District area and is easy to get around. They have a rewards program which is called an Advantage card where for every $50.00 spent you get $.10 off your purchase at their gas station called Getgo You can accrue rewards but they expire after 2 months of non use.

They have a floral section and is one of the few places I can find graveside flower arrangements for memorials.

e6GiLUdbUaPX7-P9QtHrXg,IhLPy_qJqRyGb_vGwHNeaQ,"We decided on Sapporo after reading so-so reviews on Ichiban and Benihana's.  This was a nice surprise. Yes, it is not in the best looking area, and yes, the restaurant may not be as nice as a Benihana.  But the food was quite good.  

We had our doubts at first.  We went in the middle of a Sunday afterfoon and the place was empty.  And service seemed to be a little disorganized and distracted.  But once the chef came out and got to work, it was great.  The salad and soup were veyr good, the soup being a little more beefy in flavor than what we were used to.  We then had the fried rice and got a HUGE portion.  We needed a little more soy sauce that what the chef used, but he gladly provided more and the rice was delicious.  

Then we moved to the main entrees.  Wife had the Chateaubriand and I had the Tenderloin and Scallops.  The meat, although cooked  just a tad past medium, still melted in your mouth,and the scallops were absolutely the best I've ever had!!  Again, huge portions of meat and vegetables, plus a large portion of noodles. Definitely a plateful.

We did not get the requisite show you get at this kind of restaurant, but we've seen it so many times, it's kinda boring to me.  Instead, we had a nice conservsation with the chef about the Pittsburgh area.  All in all, this was a very pleasant meal, and I'll definitely go back.",0,8Nm_jcCYtMXYW0ODSHDiXA,0,4,2012-08-06,review,1
UANFI1i2-xcOVIU8DYBdkw,qUkI_rNF-xpaQXqvdpb1hg,"I travel a lot and have eaten at a lot of Hibachi restaurants. I happen to have a project in the Pittsburgh area and was looking for a Hibachi place to take my co-workers. I read several reviews on other Hibachi places and they all sound the same. The typical they are so busy the service sucks and they rush you in and out to turn tables quickly.  I found Sapporo and was very pleased! It is in an odd location but once you step inside, you feel the ambiance of cozy and family style. My party felt the staff was very friendly.

I had ordered the filet and shrimp with fried rice. The others in my group ordered chicken broccoli, and the Sapporo Deluxe which consists of lobster, filet and shrimp. We all got started with the soup and salads, which was a pretty good size. I didn't want to finish it all because I wanted to save room for dinner. Our Chef was one of the most personable Chef's I have encountered. He was very talkative and really wanted to get to know us. My file was delicious and the fried rice was excellent. They make their fried rice from scratch. It's not prepared ahead of time like I see at most Hibachi places. I can definitely tell the difference. My friend Sam who ordered the chicken broccoli could not stop raving about the sauce that they used. It is unlike soy sauce or teriyaki sauce. We asked the Chef about the sauce and sure enough it is one of a kind. Dan, who ordered the Sapporo Deluxe was very pleased with his meal and couldn't even finish it. Actually we all needed to-go boxes. The portion amount here is incredible. You definitely get your money's worth here!!

I would highly recommend this place to Hibachi lovers because this place is surely a secret in Pittsburgh. I can not stress how different this place is compared to other Hibachi places. I think this restaurant is family owned and not a chain which I can always appreciate. 

Thank you Sapporo for a great Hibachi experience!! I will be back for sure!

5yC_sdGnYfXTX7Djp_4SVQ,9mVDyUano9-a-dIoOjTY3Q,"Sapporo is my favorite Japanese restaurant, period. I've found other places that come close, but for me, this is the place I like to spend my money when it comes to hibachi cuisine. 

Sapporo is an unassuming place right next to Steubenville Pike's hottest tourist attraction, the Pittsburgh Motel. But don't let the location fool you. Step inside and enjoy a cozy atmosphere. There's a bar at the front, some tables to the right, and the main dining area to the left. There's also that karaoke machine I've never seen used in all the years I've gone here.

Unlike other Japanese restaurants like Saga (great stuff) and Ichiban, the cooks at Sapporo aren't all about giving an extensive show while cooking. Each of the chefs have a few of the basic crowd pleasers, such as the knife and spatula toss and the onion volcano, etc., but really it's all about the food, which is fine by me. I do sometimes miss when the chefs toss the pieces of shrimp up in the air towards your mouth to catch, but only because no one ever likes to participate in that but me and it's fun to look like a goofball while trying, but that's neither here nor there.

The food here is excellent. They've introduced a new look to their menu recently. I don't know if they scaled it down, as I often always order from the same section. I did notice they have a couple of sushi options available. They used to have a full sushi bar, and you can still see that when you walk in, but I'm not sure if they're using it for anything other than just what's on the main menu, which would be a shame if so, as their sushi was always great and you could order it from a separate menu. Again, this may be something they still have that I'm not aware of.

At any rate, the starter soup and salad is great. I love the bits of onion in the soup. It's a very strong broth, but not overpowering. The ginger dressing on the salad is something you either like or loathe at any Japanese restaurant, and here I really love it, but I tend to like it everywhere I've had it, so I'm not a real stickler when it comes to that.

Usually I order the filet mignon and shrimp with fried rice for my main meal, though last time I got the deluxe version of the dish which also includes lobster tail and ice cream for dessert. Either way, it's a great dish. I've also had the chicken and shrimp and have enjoyed it as well.

Now, my favorite thing here is the shrimp sauce. I call it the ""magic sauce."" It's of the light pink variety and thin consistency. I'm always disappointed when I go to other Japanese steakhouses and they either don't have shrimp sauce altogether or they have the thicker, mayonnaise-based version, which is OK, but doesn't come close to the awesomeness that is the magic sauce. Apparently it's a secret as to just what goes into it. On one visit our chef joked that its main base was strawberry Quik, which one of the fellow diners at my table believed.

So if you get the fried rice here, dump some of the magic sauce on there. It's amazing. Use it for your steak or chicken as well. I find myself doing that and then saving the darker sauce for my grilled veggies, which are also top notch here. Terrific grilled onions and ripe zucchini as well as mushrooms and broccoli. I don't care for broccoli personally, but the rest is excellent.

Sapporo has also started throwing in noodles to the mix. According to the owner this is because other restaurants started doing it, so patrons who came in started asking why Sapporo didn't have them as well. I think they were doing fine without them, as it just adds even more to an already large amount of food, but they are good, if unnecessary.

The steak here is great. I've had the sirloin as well as the filet. I always get mine cooked rare, and it is of the melt in your mouth caliber. The shrimp never taste fishy, and the lobster tail is similarly excellent. All around, you get a great meal here for the price.

I'm not sure which nights are more crowded than not anymore. Sapporo's a funny place in that some weeknights you'll drive by and it's packed and then other nights it will be quiet. I'd suppose weekends draw the biggest crowds. Yet even when it was ""packed"" I've never had to wait long to be seated at a table.

So if you haven't been, give Sapporo a try. It's been there forever. The owner and staff are super nice and they really do care about serving you great food when you visit. They don't do lunches anymore, so it's strictly dinner meals, so be looking at spending at least 20-30 dollars on up for adults, and around 10 or so for kids' meals. It's not some place you would go frequently if you're on a budget, but that makes it all the more a treat when you do go.",0,8Nm_jcCYtMXYW0ODSHDiXA,0,5,2014-07-26,review,2

The restaurant is located in front of a dimly lit motel but don't be discouraged by the facade because once you step inside the door the atmosphere is warm and inviting. 

We were greeted by the owner's daughter who sat us at an empty table while we waited for the other guests to join us. The owner's son brought us menus to look over and informed us that Sapporo is a family-run establishment. The table quickly filled with regulars who said that Sapporo was their favorite Hibachi restaurant in Pittsburgh, one couple even said that they come for dinner every single Saturday evening. The owner himself came over to our table and began cooking our meal!

I ordered the Hibachi chicken and broccoli in Sapporo special sauce and my boyfriend ordered the Hibachi shrimp and chicken, both with fried rice. Both meals were good but the special sauce on my chicken was absolutely delicious! Definitely one of the best Hibachi chicken variation that I have tasted and my boyfriend really enjoyed how flavorful his shrimp tasted.

Hot Sausage, Sweet Sausage, Meatballs etc.   There are frozen food items available too - pasta, sauce, meatballs etc. There is also a shelf in the store stocked with sausage buns, sauce and other items.  I often stop after work to grab dinner because they are open until 6:00.    Specials:  Pazzo Monday: any sandwich or  1/2 sausage roll with a soft drink is $5.99.  Tuesday/Thursday: Mac and Cheese with ground hot sausage $2.75 per serving.   Friday: Sherrys Pasta e'Fagoli $3.75 per serving Wednesday/Saturday: (MY FAVORITE SPECIAL):  Homemade Lasagna - made with homemade sauce, Tallutos lasagna pasta, grande and lamagna cheese and ricci ground hot sausage $4.25 per serving.  I must tell you that the lasagna is my favorite menu item at Ricci and anytime I get it .. when I eat it.. I get into a ""zone"". And I don't ever share.. yes it's THAT good.

I love to make my own spaghetti sauce using Ricci Italian Sausage.  I have tried using other types of sausages - like giant eagle brand but you can always tell when its ""Ricci's Sausage"" because it's a good batch of sauce and everyone raves about it.

Their steak hoagie is middling-good; nothing to write home about, but a pretty good example of the standard Pittsburgh pizza place steak hoagie.

The seafood calzone is another story. Something in it was so bitter I couldn't quite eat it; I'm wondering if it was the garlic or perhaps a leftover burnt taste from the oven. Whatever it was, it was gross. The shrimp weren't that good either, suffering as they did from that certain ""I taste like iodine"" flavor.

The advantage to R&B is that they're open reasonably late, given the location, but the phone service is rather surly and it always takes them an hour plus to deliver.

kWkgwRxqWD-h260dMTkHUA,A_C28_4et1R9NVG9ojl81Q,"I stopped by here two nights ago as part of a night where I would try three different pizzas in the Bellevue/Avalon area.  I called my order in for an XL pizza ahead of time and was told that I would have a 15 minute wait until it was ready.  Since I only had a general idea of where it was located I ended up parking near it trying to locate it and then driving past it before finally locating it in a small strip mall right next to Lincoln Ave.  There isn't too much to say about the inside of this pizza place except that they have a counter up front with a little bit of room to wait and no customer seating, not that this is a bad thing.

Pizzas in general can be broken down into three separate components: cheese, crust and sauce.  This pizza actually had the least amount of cheese on it of all of the pizzas that we tried but ended up being my favorite which would be surprsing if you know me.  The cheese was not that strong in flavor but the amount of it let it pair perfectly with the sauce which had a nice spice profile (strong on the garlic and maybe some oregano?) coming through it.  The crust on this pizza was the thinnest of the bunch that we tried and was cooked nicely which also had a little crisp which I loved.  

The bottom line for me is that I would head back to R & B's again in the future for pizza.

My fiance, a friend and I were trying pizza from three different places and Luigi's was one of them.  I have driven by Luigi's many times before and for some reason had never stopped in but that did allow it to come to mind whenever I was looking for a pizza place I had not yet tried in the Bellevue area.  Whenever I called to place my order I was told that my pizza would be ready in about 15 minutes.  I arrived closer to 30 minutes later and was immediately confused whenever I walked into the restaurant.  You see there was a large dining room on the left that was full of people and I didn't immediately see the are where I would get my pizza from.  Finally after a few steps into the restaurant I noticed that the whole back area of the restaurant was where I needed to be and I made my way back there.  My pizza was ready for me and I quickly paid and was leaving whenever the cashier told me ""Stay out of trouble"".  I really hope that was a friendly sentiment and not one that was based upon my appearance or anything else.  The pizza itself had a medium thick crust with a bland sauce which is weird since I could see a ton of green herbs in it.  The cheese was just ok and nothing special while the pizza itself had a slightly sour taste to it which I did not enjoy.  Out of the three different pizzas we ate that night this one was overwhelmingly our least favorite which was evidenced by the fact that 3/4 of it was left after the evening.

The bottom line for me is that I will probably not head back to Luigi's in the future.

tAKjY3bQXH51msJbOHYPmQ,J_YCuxcejf_HivFLK6tJbA,"Recently I've found myself patronizing Bellevue a little more, namely because I've bought a house in the area, and have been checking out some of the mom and pops along the little strip of Mayberry RFD that is the quaint main street. Luigi's is one of those little mom and pops that offers standard basic Italian in a comfortable setting. It's a little kitchy, red-white-and-green, with Dino and Frankie tunes playing in the background.

I've stopped in on several occasions now for dinner, with various friends, and the food has been consistent...it's good...satisfying. Not over-the-top gourmet, or even in the remotest sense 'pretentious'. It's just a good ol' night out for some pasta or lasagna, with a side salad, garlic bread and conversation with your pals.

The portions are ample, the prices are reasonable, the flavors won't knock your socks off and make you think you've died and gone to Sicily, but they won't make you cringe at having given your money to a profiteering Chef Boyardee either. The service is decent, kind of point blank, not rude, nor over the top friendly. 

The crowd can fluctuate between 'Oh my god, I'm surrounded by Hillbillies' to 'the local gathering at Mayberry', but that seems to be the norm for most places in da burgh.

I've not had the pizza, which apparently get raves, because frankly I only think of pizza as coming in a box to my front door when I'm too lazy to do any cooking at home. But I've had three or four of the pasta dishes, and they come in a generous portion, with a side salad and an order of garlic toast. They taste fine, fill you up, and don't break your bank.

And for a local neighborhood joint, that's exactly what I'd hope for. A place you can go to find a dependable and reasonable meal, on a semi-regular basis, in a comfortable setting, with no frills or pretense.

I ordered the General Tso tofu, a favorite dish of mine, and hubby ordered the beef Mei Fun noodles. We always grab some egg rolls too. The lady on the phone wasn't rude, per se, but she wasn't exactly helpful or answering any of my questions, either (hubby wanted to see about getting a different sauce on his noodles, and I had to ask a few times before she finally answered my question about how large the tofu dish was). I was in a good mood though, so the attitude over the phone didn't bother me. Price was good, typical takeout rates. The good news is that they will allow you to pay with credit cards over the phone, so if you're like me and never carry cash, you can still get delivery. She told me 45 minutes for the food.

The food arrived in about 20 minutes (we live half a mile away), it was hot and smelled great. Hubby's Mei Fun looked typical, but he was saddened to see that they didn't exchange the white sauce for brown sauce. The beef was pretty mushy, and didn't taste all that great. The veggies were fresh, and pretty crispy even after soaking in sauce. Noodles were alright, nothing to write home about. My General Tso tofu was delicious, and tasted exactly like the dish I was craving. Fried to perfection, perfect-sized pieces of tofu, and a fantastic sauce. The broccoli was fresh and tasted good. This particular dish only came in one size: Enormous. I think hubby and I just ended up sharing my meal, paired with some mediocre egg rolls.

So, long story short, lady on the phone was a bit irritating, delivery was fast, food was fresh, and, depending on what you order, the food quality ranges from so-so to great.

rL7tj-6DtdzGpwC6WW1umw,noymXHrtAOOuvJONqvuKKA,"I was in need of a pedicure before my beach vacation, so I decided to stop in to Star Nails in Bellevue. I've never had a pedicure before, mostly because I'm super-ticklish, but I felt like it was about time.

The salon looks quite nice inside; wood (well, laminate) floors, clean decor, and four pedicure chairs up on the platform on the right. I didn't have an appointment, and waited about ten minutes on a Wednesday evening.

Nancy was my nail technician, and she greeted me warmly and helped me over into the pedicure area. Pro tip: Don't wear a past-knee-length skirt, as it can make straddling the foot bath to get into the chair slightly awkward. Nancy helped me out like a pro and I was all set.

The pedicure chairs have a massage feature that reminded me of the Migun massage tables. They don't just vibrate; they knead. The controller is right next to you, so you can stop and start as you like. I just made sure the thing kept running the whole time. The foot bath was nice and warm. I'd brought a book to keep myself busy but turns out all my attention was occupied by relaxing.

Nancy guided me through the steps and the slight language barrier isn't much of a problem. She completely understood that I was super-ticklish from the flinching involved, and somehow managed to be very careful about it. It wasn't at all unpleasant, which is what I'd kind of expected.

This is the awful TMI section, so avert your ayes if you are at all sensitive. Since I've never had a pedicure and I tend to walk around either barefoot or in thin-soled shoes, I had quite a lot of callus built up. The removal was kind of disgusting, so I just didn't look, but it didn't hurt at all. I also tend to ingrown toenails on both big toes, and she dealt with them gently and quickly. I was a bit concerned about having that done at a salon, but it's a week later and my toes haven't turned gangrene, so all's well that ends well.
END TMI

Even though it wasn't the spa pedicure (not sure what else THAT involves), I got a full foot and calf massage. Polish on and all done! At which point I thought I might as well get a manicure, too.

The manicure involved heated mitts and a hand massage, and was very nice. Total cost was $37 plus tip (I gave her $10 for having to deal with my nasty feet). I had some fun conversations with other patrons, and overall a great experience. I'd go back once a day if it were in any way reasonable to do so, but this is getting placed on the once-a-month schedule for sure.

The polish from the pedicure is still holding up like a champ after a week. The manicure was pretty well shot after a couple of days, so I'll probably just stick with doing the polish at home, although I can't complain about the massage and cuticle care.

Again, I don't have other salons or spas to compare with, but it seemed like a good, basic service with a few little extras. The staff were all friendly and remembered the repeat customers who came in. They do take credit cards, and you can put the tip on the card as well; I brought cash for that as I am not used to salons taking tips on cards.

They also offer acrylics (which I don't do), gel nails (which I'd like to try), and nail art. I'm not sure if they do waxing. I am sure that it's a friendly place, that it's clean (important!), and that they made me feel relaxed even though I was beyond nervous going in.",1,jTAKV9zLlAjouAKh4Wd7Yg,0,3,2011-08-23,review,1

We each picked a color, and went to our respective technicians. The technician doing my nails as very nice and talkative, but just very inattentive to detail. I got no hand/arm massage, minimal shaping, and the polish application was exceptionally sloppy and thick. Her attempts to clean up the polish all over my cuticles were futile. Their actual technique was strange too, as both technicians had us dry our nails after the first coat was applied.

Dr. Fitzgerald provided an affordable diabetes treatment plan for my cat to prolong his life; the prognosis went from a few months to three healthy years.  When my cat suddenly had kidney failure from diabetic shock, I was only charged for the treatment--not the emergency appointment fees. The staff was extremely considerate when my cat passed--some who knew him were even crying.

My other cat gained a reputation as a menace.  But the staff never complained--not even when she required four people to hold her down just to get her shots.

When I was sold a diseased turtle a a child, Dr. Moore was very kind and did not charge for the visit nor the medication.  He recognized my interest in science and patiently answered all of my 11-year-old questions.  He even showed me how he made slides and how his microscope worked. (I later studied biology and worked as a lab tech, so thanks.)  Dr. Moore also took exemplary care of our rabbits, who all lived unusually long lives.

On a practical note, they require ALL animals to be in a cage or on a leash.  I once had a well-behaved cat, who was too sick to chase the dogs, wrapped in a blanket since his collar would have been over an open wound...But they generally enforce the cage/leash policy for the safety of all animals.

My father had to ask where to take Abby so she could get the care she needed.  Only then, after you performed unnecessary tests did you tell him about the specialty hospital. The care you provided our dog was awful and I hope no one has to go thru what we did.  I stand by my original post.  This vet is only out for the money.

There are photographs of the owners and chefs family on the walls.... its cute. My boyfriend called ahead and told them i was vegetarian and the chef prepared a couple of things for me.  There is no set menu and the waitress reads out what the chef has prepared for the night there are 5 courses. an appetizer, pasta, main course, a salad and and dessert. I thought the salad after the entree was pretty interesting . They are also very generous with the bread which i LOVED!!!!
Every meal was made to perfection. It had a homey feeling .....
My boyfriend had some scallops that he is still talking about.  My entree was spaghetti squash with mushroom wild rice and berries and limed artichokes. There were soo many flavors and all the ingredients were balanced. The service was great.
 All in all it was an amazing experience. The chef came out to say hi at the end of the night...... i finished off my dinner with the creme brulee and some coffee. Our bill came to $120 with tip and it was absolutely worth it .
This is a great restaurant for a super special occasions and  it is very private.Not to dressy and not too casual.
 Pick out a great bottle of wine or two and get ready to get your taste buds blown.

I had desperately needed a haircut and walked in for a major trim and re-shaping of my layers.  First, the girl at the counter said my hair might be ""difficult"" due to the length (it was nearly long enough to sit on at the time) and that I would probably have to stand while it was cut.  Weird, but okay.  Second, no one there knew anything about donating to ""Locks of Love,"" and I feel like salons should be aware of things like that.  I needed a cut so I went for it anyway.

I watched the two stylists while I waited for my turn.  One stylist told the client whose hair she was cutting that she was going to do something other than what they discussed because it ""wasn't looking right.""  Ummm, okay.  The other stylist was too busy checking her phone every three seconds to notice she was yanking on her client's hair so hard with the comb that she was giving her poor client whiplash.

Git ahta tahn.... when it comes to donuts, pastries, and cakes they don't hold a wisk to Lincoln Bakery in Bellevue (or most Western PA bakeries for that matter).  Their cakes hit the top of my list (with Edy's downtown coming in second).  The batter is light and moist while the icing is smooth -- not too sweet - not too 'lardy'.  By all means, feel free to give them a decorating challenge as their peeps got mad skillz.

In my experience, Pittsburgh natives don't seem to realize how good their sweet tooths have it here, till they move away.  So, when I travel westward for the holidays I bring some Lincoln Bakery sweets along.

I highly recommend their Burnt Almond Torte with either custard or lemon filling for nearly any occasion.  I get these for corporate gatherings often and they always go over well - and you know what they say about trying to please everyone!

I'd suggest giving them a few days to a weeks notice as they keep pretty busy.

The cakes are incredibly moist and the butter cream icing is just the right amount of sweet. My favorite cake is a yellow cake with FUDGE icing (not chocolate but FUDGE)!! I've also had the raspberry filling and would recommend that as well. They are incredibly creative with their decorating of the cakes including wedding cakes but if you want something specialized (nonstandard icing, etc) be sure to call ahead and place your order in advance. Warning: Saturday mornings you will surely encounter a very, very long line whether picking up your order or just swinging by for some goodies. 

Even better than their cakes are their petit-fours (chocolate with chocolate icing or white with vanilla icing). I've ordered them for bridal showers or just stopped by to pick one up for myself. They are the perfect size for one person (if you aren't on a diet). They do sell out of these so place an order ahead of time if you want a large order or stop by early in the morning to make sure you can get them. 

I've gotten cookies from here and they were average. I think this is the best bakery in the Burgh for cakes but not necessarily all other pastries and breads. 

The only reason I didn't rate the bakery 5 stars is their customer service which is borderline horrific.

I purchased an assortment of these to take to a dinner party and they were all gobbled up and it was a great way to allow everyone to try small bites of a variety of treats.  My personal favorite was the Chocolate Mousse cake because I love chocolate and it was sweet without being overly sweet, creamy, with the right balance of sweet and bitter from the chocolate.  I also sampled the tiramisu which was delicate with just a hint of espresso and the cream was perfect.  The best thing was that while the desserts were all obviously sweet they weren't so sweet that it was sickening as I've experienced with more commercial cakes from grocery or big box stores.  The other cakes that I bought and all of which the dinner attendees loved were the lemon cake, the oreo cheesecake, one called the sweet spot that had chocolate and peanut butter, and finally a white cake with chocolate frosting.

My cake--and I'm not just being partial here--was the tastiest wedding cake I ever had.  As I lived in another state at the time, my mom went to sample the cakes and was given exceptionally large samples--in fact, she was given entire cakes.  We ended up going with a yellow cake with alternating tiers of fresh strawberry and lemon filling.  The staff was helpful, and adaptable when I inevitably changed my mind about the design.  The bakery was able to delivery the cake to my location, and it arrived fresh.  Unlike most wedding cakes, this cake was incredibly moist, and the buttercream icing was smooth and not overly sweet (which I hate).  My venue saved the top tier; my husband and I didn't wait until our first anniversary to eat it--we ate it that week!  Highly recommend.",0,7wT532x2Qz5Hw9BqtBapqw,0,5,2016-06-26,review,0

He's a sweet Italian man who still gets down on his knees to hem your dress. I had him hem and take out a dress I suddenly needed for a wedding and he did a great job. It needed taken out pretty significantly, but he made sure to hide his work so you couldn't tell. The lining didn't match and it couldn't be let out all over, but I think that was the dress rather than him. It was a little more than I expected- $100, but he called to let me know he was ordering more lining since he couldn't get enough from the hem. 

His shop is tiny- be careful, if you're standing by the dressing room looking at yourself in the mirror in a dress that's too small, you're the first thing the next customer sees when they come in.

_vwy7eTm8V5yHw_QxhVDBA,yrFHqq-0LLH7Y2fpanBYYg,"I stopped into Discount Tire Center on 65 in Bellevue because one of my tires was slowly dying.  I had planned to get two new tires.  Admittedly, this place looks a little scary...to me anyhow, but as a girl by herself all garages are pretty intimidating.  I didn't know how these things worked...did I need to call ahead for an appt?  I needed new tires ASAP, so an appt wasn't an option.  Luckily, the guys at Discount Tire Center took great care of me.  

I pulled in, hesitantly got out of my car and wandered into the garage.  A man promptly greeted me and asked me what he could do.  I asked for two new tires, he took a quick look at my car and told me, ""No problem, pull it in"".  

He discussed the options of tires in a way I could understand, giving his suggestions but ultimately leaving the decision up to me.  He also let me know about a rebate on 4 tires, which I ended up getting (after a frantic call to my husband asking if I was stupid for being upsold).  It ended up being a great deal and I never felt pressured to buy more.

I sat in the waiting area (which could use a woman's touch to be sure) for about 10 minutes and they were done.  SO FAST!  The man explained everything with the rebate and I left a happy camper.

My wife badly needed new tires so we went to all the local spots to compare prices, Mr Tire, Pep Boys, Sam's Club, Flynn's etc. While leaving Flynn's a woman flagged us down and asked if we needed tires and told us about Discount Tire.

A few days later we decided to give them a try. We went with a new Continental Tire that had just hit the market that came highly recommended by the service guy. What's really cool is that they are like a Nascar Pit Crew. There are actually four guys working on your vehicle at the same time taking the old tires off and mounting, balancing and putting the new ones on.

Wouldn't ya know, as I was filling the tire yesterday I noticed that a shiny nail had punctured the tire. So, I finally gave in and went back to Discount Tire this morning.

This was my second time here in the past couple months and the service was just as great as the last time. I was worried I might have to buy a new tire, but they were able to fix both nail punctures. Yep! There were two nails in the tire that were causing the slow leak.

IRJO2c-bZbrjQYE4306i3A,dE77tge7WN36pFQ8py_hQg,"The only word I can use to describe my experience at Discount Tire Center is.... WOW!   I found this place thanks to a verbal reference from my Brother-In-Law.  I decided to check them out on Yelp before calling to get prices and saw all of the positive reviews.  I'm here to tell you that this place is awesome!

First, let's start with the price.  I needed 4 tires for my Town and Country.  I had done some shopping around for prices and these guys were less than everyone else by about $50.00.  On top of that, there also happened to be a $40.00 mail-in rebate for the tires I purchased but they can't really control manufacturer discounts so I can't give them credit for that.  My point is, based on price alone; I had to give them a shot.

Now, let's talk about my experience.  I called over before I went in to ask exactly how long it would take to have the tires installed.  I explained that I could take a long lunch break but anything longer than 2 hours wouldn't work.  They explained that there weren't any other customers there at the moment, but with them being an appointment-free shop it was hard to say how long it would take.  I decided to take the chance and headed over on my lunch hour.  I arrived at about 12:05 and expected that I'd need to park, go in, talk about a price, etc.  To my surprise, I pulled up and they waved me right into one of the garage doors.  I got out of my car and a guy met me at the door and started talking tires.  The very first real question was, am I looking for inexpensive or top-of the-line tires.  It seemed to me that they weren't going to even bother pricing the expensive tires if I simply wasn't interested.  Being my family vehicle I explained that I wanted ""Just under"" top-of-the-line.  I then explained that I called in a few days prior and someone priced out a set of GoodYear tires for me.  

The conversation took all of about 2 minutes.  The gentleman then promptly communicated the tires I wanted and a team of 6 guys went to work.  Before I could get my phone out to snap a picture all four tires were off of the car and on their way to having the old tires removed.  In the end, I had paid and was driving away at 12:30.... I kid you not!  It was like having my own pit crew!  It was so quick that when I arrived home (I was working from home that day) my wife was shocked.

In closing, I can't imagine not going back to these guys for my next set of tires.  The price was awesome and the service was out of this world.  On top of that, they didn't try to sell me anything that I didn't need or want!  I'd recommend calling in to see how many people are in line.  Obviously if there had been four cars being worked on I'd have had less people to work on my car but I can't imagine the service being slow considering how efficient their operation is.",1,3bMa3PiTedlMVuyrKBE7Tg,0,5,2015-05-22,review,1

tAKjY3bQXH51msJbOHYPmQ,44V5iszqiVp8oA56VERocQ,"Wow. An actual neighborhood grocery store. Not the wannabe monopoly monster bird ripping people off left and right, but an actual neighborhood grocery store.

If you're seeking the gourmet fancy-schmancy, or the self-restrictive dietary vegan-gluten-free blah blah blah, your choices may be a little more limited, but if you're a 'normal' eater, it's a grocery store that has all of the basics and a few frills. No one will speak to you with a fake Hampton accent dahhhhhling, and you won't find a wine-tasting class with a gourmet fritter exhibition.

What you will find are regular folk who are helpful and (mostly) friendly, the usual grocery store variety of necessities and non-necessities, a nicely stocked and priced meat and produce case, a deli counter with the usual meats and cheeses and a variety of prepared foods, baked goods. It's clean and tidy, and you can stock your fridge and pantry as you see fit, and with a pleasant 'How ya doin'?'

Kuhn's still does the double-coupon thing, and they have some pretty good sales - ten boxes of pasta for ten bucks, the weekly soda sales - three fridge packs for nine bucks beats monster bird's $12.

Now I will say that on occasion, it will feel a little like you've somehow been sucked into deep Appalachia in regard to some of the clientele, but that's pretty much everywhere in da burgh that's on the 'outskirts'. Sometimes I look around me and half expect to find a rusty 1950's pick up truck full of goats in the parking lot, or a trailer park nearby.

I generally do my 'staple' shopping at Aldi, and my meat needs in the Strip, but for a nearby quick fill in, unless it's an ingredient for a specialty recipe, Kuhn's is great for the 'Oh crap - I need' kind of trip.

And quite frankly, as nice as they are, and decently priced as they are, this small business deserves our business more than the cut throat monster bird.",1,oMoSc4tTay_THqF4Ke_WrQ,1,4,2015-09-12,review,1

I've gotten month-old expired milk here before and don't even get me started on the moldy Yoplait. Second of all, and more important, the service here is terrible. The employees here act like they are forced to work here, and if you are using a card, be prepared to slide it at least three of four times since the employees are too incompetent to eat anything right the first time.

I find antique kitchenwares here that are older than my grandma, worth $85 if the antique mall is to be believed, and priced at $2.50. The 50%-off sales actually pay off here. The merchandise turns over quickly. The staff is a real cast of characters (don't miss the steelers tattoos!!! i'm seriously serious, they are amazing). there are bicycles for you and your kids in decent-semi-working condition. The balance of stuff is about half and half valuable old vintage and more modern hand-me-downs. The prices are reasonable to cheap. The plastic bags on the wall are often a treasure trove. The kitchen section could outfit your kitchen in fondue pots for days. Most thrift store remodels result in ridiculous high prices to pay for the construction. The remodel here just means a bigger, cleaner store and parking lot.

 This place is pretty large, and relatively clean, with a nice parking lot.  The racks are packed with clothes - and I mean, hard to move the hangers because there is so much stock, which can be a pro or a con depending on how you like it.  I found it a bit cumbersome since although the clothes are organized by type (dress vs. blouse) there is NO size separation.  In a place this huge, it takes quite a long time to find what you're looking for without the size separation.  But, I'm not one to abandon a bargain because I don't want to look around (after all, that is what its all about), so I gave a good 30 min-45 and got a handful of garments to try on.  (I would typically spend a few hours, but I was trying to spare a friend not as keen on secondhand garments).  With my carefully extracted finds I searched in vain for a fitting room, never to find one.  After asking the staff where it was, I had to take a seat and leave my jaw dropped for a while because THERE IS NO FITTING ROOM! 
I couldn't take this fact into my brain, and although there were some household items I wanted to go back and buy, I was too upset to continue.  (Sidenote: yes, I can understand how this can work for the RWB, but imho it is unforgivable, and I wish there was at least some warning before spending my time searching for a bargain when I couldn't even see if it would fit). 

I would recommend this store if you are looking for something specific secondhand especially for dishes, or older electronics, or even beauty products.  There was even a used Nikon SLR with a wide angle lens ($200 though)!  
But if you plan on buying a sundress, and don't plan on stripping down in front of your fellow thrifties, you'd better be confident in your purchase.  RWB is just like any other thrift store, and you can't return or exchange your items, so you'd be out of luck and out of money.",1,kKmvSJ6Z8UVPdrnL74bqrg,2,2,2009-04-15,review,3

I would make a weekly trek to RWB, and would never be disappointed.  These were the days when you could find a vintage 50s something or other on the racks, before there was a ""Vintage"" section.  Still, recently, there is always a treasure to be had, especially in the housewares department.

1. It's well lit.  You can SEE the clothing, see whatever might be wrong with it, and make an honest assessment.  You're never surprised when you leave at the state of the items you've just bought.

2. It is surprisingly clean.  Nothing seems to smell, so I can only imagine they've laundered everything thoroughly. 

3. There are good quality brands--Ann Taylor, Kenneth Cole, etc.  It's mainly items along these lines.  You're more likely to find twinsets than clubbing tops here, which if you're over the age of 21 is a good thing.

4. Markdowns and fresh merchandise.  These people *know* how to turn over their stock.  Because the place is never empty, and there are specials every day, the stock flips rapidly.  The merchandise is never the same week to week, so as I mentioned before, it's addictive.  You never know what you'll find.

A summary of a few things I've bought here: a 6 dollar designer knit dress, a few silk twinsets ($2-$5), countless heels, two pairs of Birkenstocks and two pairs of Doc Martens ($4-$8), a dressmaker's bust ($5), a pressure cooker ($7)....

You get the picture.  The prices aren't rock bottom, but close enough, and the quality of the clothing will help anyone but the stingiest person get over the 50 cents extra.

Secondly, bring cash. They DO NOT accept credit cards.

The store is full of wonderful pieces of clothing, all arranged by color and type (not by size, which is unfortunate). I found a wide selection of everything from casual pieces to high-end business attire to super-trendy teen clothing... what surprised me most about this store was the QUALITY of the clothing. Almost all of the pieces were flawless, a few were worn or faded in some way and the price reflected that. Brand names were bountiful; Banana Republic, Ralph Lauren, Chico's, Jones New York, Ann Taylor, American Eagle, H&M. There were also some wonderful vintage pieces from the 80s, bright colors and crazy shoulder pads that would have made a more adventurous fashionista very happy indeed!

The clothing smells wonderful, not musty or dirty as in some thrift stores, and there was even a large selection of plus-sized clothing carefully culled out in a special section.

I went to Red White & Blue to find some business attire for my new job, and came home with two gorgeous, flawless statement blazers from Ann Taylor Loft and Banana Republic... for a total of $7!

I love to go here and find lots of home decor items to decorate my house. candle holders, DIning sets, paints, sculptures and sooo much more. I found this small desk lamp that has a victorian look to it with the shade included for $4. The lamp shade was made of some kind of smooth material almost like leather. It's such a great find. There are plenty of items for sale at this place and most of them are in great shape. 

So the clothes which occupy most of the store are the best find. The Store has certain days that offer you %50 certain color tags. I went on a Monday and it was half off yellow and white tags. Other days its half off blue, or green or red. I love to go on Saturdays!! This past week it was half off every tag except white. I found so many items for such a cheap price. $7 shirts for $3.50 and tunics for $4. Have you ever find items for $1?? I have!!! I love when I find a great shirt or sweater for $3 or less. Or when you find a brand new item with the tags on them for under $7. I bought a brand new pair of Arizona Jeans (in my size) for $5. I couldn't believe it. I was too excited.

The clothes are organized by color but not by size which is a good and bad thing. I like to shop by color since I don't wear too many yellows or purples. I can avoid those sections all together but when I do find a nice shirt in the color I want the size becomes an issue. There were a lot of nice shirt that were just too small or too big. Even when i have to pass on a nice shirt I tend to find one that's just as good at the same price. 

Shopping here is a gold find!! My sister was the one who introduced me to this store and i used to make fun of her for shopping thrift. If I had known that It was nothing like the Good Will I would have been here a lot sooner. Now my sister makes fun f me for going so often. What an amazing place this is!!

Huge selection of clothing, housewares, electronics and furniture, but NO FITTING ROOMS!

Yes, you read that correctly. No fitting rooms. Are you kidding me?!?! It doesn't completely overshadow the fact that they have great items, but when 95% of what you offer is clothing, you've got to have a few rooms for people to try stuff on!

The clothing is organized by style and color, not by size, so be ready to dig. Same thing with the shoes.

I asked a staff member where to try on clothing and she directed me to the back corner of the store where there were two long mirrors hanging side by side on the wall, directly in front of the kitchen section. I was slightly confused for a minute and then realized that was my only option. I decided against even peeking at any pants or blouses and instead went for jackets and sweaters I could easily try on over my shirt. 

Now, the mirrors are directly side-by-side, so if there are two people trying things on over their clothes (so weird), you're going to be right up on top of them. Not to mention you'll be right on top of people browsing through the kitchen section.

A lady I was chatting with told me that she has seen women come in wearing tight fitting shirts/tank tops and spandex tights (hey, those are somehow socially acceptable as pants in public now, anyway!) so they are able to easily try everything on over their clothing (still weird).

As annoyed as I was about the fitting room situation, I will probably make a trip out there again in the future to browse based solely on the size of the store. I just might have to wear some spandex.",2,kKmvSJ6Z8UVPdrnL74bqrg,3,4,2013-11-22,review,5

I told her I had placed it on the self in the back, and said sorry for not putting it back. She said "" I walked back there and didn't see it, so where is it"" and clearly implied that i stole it.  I told her again that it was on the shelf as nice as I could and she then told me that she didn't believe me and told me to go back there and get it or else she was going to search me. Now I get that it doesn't matter that the shirt was 50 cents because stealing is still wrong but because I didn't steal it and told her so I feel Im justified in being furious that I was publicly humiliated and falsely accused over 50 cents. I walked to the back of the store picked it up and started walking back and then the lady said in a grossly rude tone "" well I didn't see it back there"" no apology, no nothing.

The prices.  9.99 for a shirt that was a donated good to this organization.  Most other thrift stores charge around 2.00-3.00 dollars.
No returns.
No dressing room to try on the overly-priced shirt that is nonreturnable.
A small mirror in a far corner of the store is offered as an option.

They really need to pull some tables out of there to make more room.  We were right on top of another table with two very loud young children, and there was just no buffer.  And the food was.... just so bland!  I get that it was supposed to be homestyle cooking, but it just had no flavor.  To be fair, we did go for dinner, and I understand that this place is more of a breakfast joint, so I would be willing to try it again sometime for breakfast.

They have a wide selection of breakfast options.  However, even with numerous breakfast specials listed, not one included eggs, meat, potatoes AND toast.  Yes, that's right.  I had to order the eggs, bacon and toast special with a side of the potatoes.  When my food was served, the portions were average except for the side order of potatoes.  I did greatly enjoy the potatoes, though, which I ordered deep fried.  My dining companion ordered the French toast with ham and enjoyed it very much.  

We were here on a weekday morning so we didn't have to worry about it being crowded.  The service was good.

We were lucky that we went fairly early as a line developed shortly after we were seated at our table.  The Rusty Nail is prepared for this in a pretty cool way though as they have a list outside of the restaurant that you can sign into as well as some coffee to partake of while you wait.

For my entree I decided to go with one of the specials for the day which was the Rusty Nail omelet while my girlfriend decided on another special which was the a mushroom, spinach and feta junior omelet.  Her omelet is self explanatory while mine had in it some salami, cheese and three pieces of sliced pepperoni on top of it.  It was readily apparent that the pepperoni was not the cheap kind that you get on most pizzas as it had more flavoring and tasted much better.  Both omelets came with sides of home fries and toast for which we both ordered deli rye.  The junior omelet tasted good as the sourness of the feta played nicely with earthy mushrooms while the spinach made it feel like I was eating healthy.  My omelet was just as good if not better than the junior omelet as the cheese and meats combined to make it seem like I was almost eating a pizza.  Some of my hash browns were slightly overcooked and they had too many onions for my taste but we still decent enough to be a side to the main show.

The bottom line for me is that I would definitely head back here in the future.  Everything that I tasted was good and I would not hesitate to take any of my friends here for a breakfast.",1,ucKQlQvOeJxETLNkpKcaSw,0,4,2012-07-23,review,1

tAKjY3bQXH51msJbOHYPmQ,PbShi6oerP0TxfuYZADazQ,"I am very happy to be moving into a 'neighborhood' that has a line-up of decent mom-and-pop shops to find a reasonable meal when the cupboard is bare, or the energy banks are depleted for cooking. Bellevue does seem to have a small collection of decent eats at reasonable prices, and The Rusty Nail is one of that handful of good examples of neighborhood haunts.

It's touted as a 'diner' in many of the reviews, but it really is a step above your average 'diner', and is more of a cozy neighborhood gathering spot for a decent burger, or entree. I've not made it there for the breakfast, but have always been satisfied by the dinners.

Rusty Nail is hardly on the gourmet end of the scale. In fact, I would imagine the Sysco truck pulls up out back regularly with deliveries of food parts, from cans of sauces to frozen animal chunks. As long as those parts are assembled and doctored to make them seem a bit fresher than the typical conveyor-belt diner, all is fine. And indeed, all IS fine.

So few of our local 'diners' are up to snuff when it comes to serving up decent 'diner' fare, that I can't call Rusty Nail a diner. It's a neighborhood family restaurant. Period.

Burgers, meatloaf, pot roast, fish sammiches, salads, pastas...a varied but adequate menu. Fair and decent prices. Friendly and attentive service. A cozy enough atmosphere (although I have to say AGAIN in a review of a restaurant, if you've got multiple TVs in the space, for gods sake, can ONE of them NOT be showing SPORTS coverage??) and a pleasant crowd of patrons. 

During my last visit, there was a large family gathering at the next table. A nicely polished middle-class clan, ranging in age from gramps to granddaughter. At one point, dad received a phone call on his cell...and actually stepped OUTSIDE to have his conversation. As I was leaving I had to pat him on the back and thank him for being one of the few remaining decent guys with manners!

Bottom line...Rusty Nail is comfortable. It's not a drive-out-of-you-way destination for dining. It is what it is. A great little neighborhood spot FOR the neighborhood.

The omelets were well prepared and served with toast.  Potatoes were and extra $2.29, but a serving of potatoes was enough for two.  Breakfast for four adults was about $50 including tip.  All adults had coffee or tea and a full breakfast.

I got the eggs benedict which is my go-to, however I didn't care for this version. Instead of hollandaise sauce, the dish comes with CHEESE sauce. Not my favorite that it came on a thin English muffin either, but our potatoes were good. (Two options: deep fried and pan fried with onions. We got both and thought the deep fried were best.

There are signs posted on the wall telling you not to use your cellphone when you are ordering, They accept credit cards not debit with a minimal $10.00 purchase. That is never a problem for me since my banking cards have both options attached to them. They also won't service you if you are in line straddling a bike.

The size of the cones they serve are reminiscent of Isaly's. Prices are reasonable for the quantity you get. Believe me when I say unless you are very hungry order a small. It is huge!

in addition to soft serve cones and cups they also offer hard ice cream in various flavors. I got to chat with the owner Mary who makes these flavors up herself and adds her own special touch to them. Yes, you can sample them. Since I prefer hard ice cream I settled for two scoops of Black Forest ice cream complete with cherries. She offered me a lid and explained the things the business does.

In addition to selling ice cream and the usual flare every Fri and Sun evenings when it is nice they have a DeeJay come out and play music from the 50s. Once a month they have a special event. Recently they had a group of students from CMU come out and teach people how to line dance. They have a car cruise in the works. More information she told me can be found either on their website or Facebook page.

My ice cream was very good and quite filling! There are a couple of picnic tables you can sit at if you wish. There isn't very much parking in the area. They also have a rewards card. You must spend a minimum of $3.00 to get a hole punch and then after 10 punches you get $1.00 off your purchase.  They also have ice cream for purchase if you want a quart, half gallon, etc. Costs a bit more than the grocery stores but hey if it's good then it's worth the money to me.

G4c2pEqqP2wpE6BlJiMs4g,6ZMC31IXHBBlIYv340SfNg,"If I could give Dr. Murphy less than 1 star, I absolutely would.  I was a big fan of his for several years.  He is a very personable guy.  I consistently went to my 6 month cleanings, and each time he would assure me that my teeth were perfect.  At my last visit, he identified a cavity in one of my molars.  Because of its placement, it was a LARGE filling.  Ever since having the tooth filled, it consistently traps huge amounts of food and it is incredibly hard to floss because of the size of the filling.  I recently moved across the country and had to find a new dentist.  WOW--I was in for the shock of my life.  Not only do I have to have 4 of my fillings replaced, but the one that Murphy did most recently has an obscene overhang that presses into an adjacent tooth.  The new dentist was shocked at the quality of work.  He also asked me if my previous dentist ever recommended that I see an orthodontist about my tilted lower molars.  I said absolutely not, I was told that there's nothing they could do about them aside from extracting the teeth and replacing them with implants.  The new dentist couldn't believe that!  He said that would be incredibly drastic and unreasonable and that the molars could very likely be corrected with some brackets.  It upsets me that Dr. Murphy would have allowed me to have unnecessary and costly dental work, and that his preventive care was so sub-par.  I am suffering the consequences of trusting an individual who is either ignorant, apathetic, or both.  Do not go here--find another dentist.",0,_hY-j2OLXL_45_x2T4gQtA,0,1,2016-02-10,review,1

There's a level of comfort and its obvious & appreciated.

Every good thing about this place is equaled with a bad thing about this place - hence it probably deserves 3 stars. I would really give it a 3.5 if available as this is currently my beer distributor of choice, but since its not possible I have to go with 4.

And yet somehow, I wind up being the girl who is sent out to buy beer for the party full of random people at our house who all like different beer.

Here's a rundown of what happened on a recent night that this occurred at Pistella's:

Me: ::wanders around for 15 minutes overwhelmed with beer choices, before giving up and going to the register::
Dude working at Pistella's: Need help?
Me: Yes. I do not drink this stuff, but everyone coming to my house tonight does. Help!
Dude: Any idea what your friends like?
Me: Umm... my husband likes to drink Dos Equis. My one friend likes 'lighter' beers. Oh, and I am broke because I just bought a lot of chips and salsa at Whole Foods.
Dude: Girl just follow me. Here, we are having a sale on the Dos Equis variety pack. That has something for all of your friends. It even has a Christmas beer to make everyone get in the holiday spirit! You will be the hero of the party! And I will carry this to the register for you and everything.
Me: Thank you!
My friends, later that night: Girl you rock. We are all happy with this beer, and that leaves more vodka for you!

You won't find super obscure beers here in general, and I didn't look for Belgians, but they had plenty of IPAs for me to choose from.  Ithaca Flower Power, Loose Canon, Lagunitas IPA, Full Pint Chinookie and TriPA, and more.  I believe I even saw some Green Flash.  However, I went with a case of Lagunitas Sucks!, not an IPA per-se, but a beer that's been hard to find anywhere and has a 98 ""world class"" score on Beer Advocate.  It set me back $40 ($42.79 with tax).

My trip was complete with the neighborhood smelly drunk asking me where the $10 case on sale was, the college dude looking for the same thing, and another man apologizing for accidentally complaining about bedroom issues with the gf within my hearing.  I considered all of this a plus.  Great atmosphere, and the staff was friendly too, though I only needed help in wanting less beer.

I'll probably be back for some Flower Power in a week or two.

My lady friend and I started with a pair of appetizers: greens & beans and ""Italian frites.""  The latter, which the menu described as ""fresh cut, twice cooked, fresh herbs & roasted garlic,"" were basically just regular-ass french fries - decent, but nowhere near worth their $6 price tag.  The greens and beans were even more of a rip-off: 8 FREAKIN' DOLLARS for a smallish bowl of rather flavorless produce.  Talk about a profit margin!

As a main course we shared a flatbread with goat cheese, caramelized onions, and roasted red pepper.  It was pretty good, but my enjoyment was diminished by the FM radio that was blaring through the loudspeakers.  Who wants to hear car commercials while eating a meal at a ""nice"" restaurant?  Classless.

My boyfriend had the scallops and I have the pino benedict (eggs benedict, of course).  My boyfriend literally looked like he was having a religious experience with the scallops.  His eyes were closed, he was moaning, and it took him about 25 minutes to eat 3 scallops.  He said it was the first time in his life that he ever wanted to take so much time to chew his food.

A relatively encompassing selection of appetizers and entrees revealed not quite a soul-crushing, but certainly a lackadaisical attitude toward ingredients, recipes and presentation, though the service was refreshingly excellent.

We had reservations for 5 people at 7PM this past Saturday. Two of us were there early and rudely treated by the hostess. She was vague about seating us and we decided to wait at the bar. When the rest of our group arrived (on time!!), I informed the hostess and she looked at me blankly and then the packed restaurant.  She told me it would be awhile. Huh? When asked what ""awhile"" was, she said 20min.  But then seated us in 5 (she had to bus a table which I take it as one of the things she dislikes about her job - that and people).

Food was a let down. Potato latkes were greasy and blah.  Fish tacos were recommended and were basically fried fish sticks.  Pumpkin risotta was heavy and confusing flavor wise.  Others had the same sentiments.

Service was rough.  Long waits and lack of attentiveness. Noise level (couldn't converse at all) made the night just a bit harer to tolerate.

I, too, decided to give Pino's a shot once we saw how packed nearby Point Brugge, which had initially drawn our party due to its reputation, was. It was a relatively nice evening, and I thought the concept of fresh-air dining was too good to pass us by. We were immediately greeted by Jen, one of the co-owners, as we entered. I made it a point to compliment the beautiful inlaid tile in our tabletop, and she volunteered some additional information about their production that I found to be very interesting. 

I really loved the bistro burger. I requested it to be prepared ""Medium"", and sure enough it lived up to my expectations---you'd be surprised how many times I've ordered a medium burger only to have it served well-done and nearly bone-dry at other restaurants. Nicole, our waitress, proved her weight in gold when she reassured me that gorgonzola would be a good cheese to accompany the bacon on the burger. We also ordered the macaroni & cheese as an appetizer. I thought the ziti was a bit dry, but the sauce and cheese were delicious. We really loved the bread and the garlic butter spread. I was hoping for an oil & vinegar blend to have with the bread, but the spread served as a surprisingly tasty alternative. My partner's ravioli looked delicious, and he let me try one of his meatballs, which I found to have that ""homemade"" flavor that's difficult to find at many restaurants. Our friend loved her arugula salad, and as a seafood aficionado I was impressed by the very generous size of the shrimp she had. Our service was prompt---our water glasses had barely gone half-empty before our waitress scurried over to replenish them.

Brunch menu has both traditional brunch fair and some Italian twists. My mum had Challah French toast and loved it. Pops had their breakfast risotto with a fried egg on top - I tried that and it had a nice kick to it.

My favorite appetizer there is the sizzling olives--they bring you a little cast iron skillet and throw olives in it--they soften and are so wonderful to eat!  Flavor explodes in your mouth!

IQWFQD0ZZVa5XoLnWCDTlQ,qSgAF24dhxs7Dr_xCnuafA,"BEFORE Pino's was renovated, it was a tiny, unpretentious, hole-in-the-wall restaurant with a friendly atmosphere, and amazing Italian food. It was also a BYOB, which I love. This was our ""go-to"" restaurant.

AFTER Pino's was renovated, there was a complete transformation. While the interior is now very nice, It's no longer a BYOB, and the staff is full of attitude, which seems to stem from the total arrogance of Pino himself.

On our most recent visit, we were a party of four with reservations at 7:30 PM. We arrived at 7:25, and weren't even acknowledged until 7:40 PM. Pino was playing maitre d', and when he finally acknowledged our presence he seemed totally clueless and was overtly UN-apologetic. There were no open tables, despite having reservations. When 8:00 PM rolled around, I was frantically calling other local restaurants to see if we could get in. No such luck, since it was prime dining time on Saturday night. Finally, around 8:30 PM, the waitstaff brought a two person table up from the basement, crowded four chairs around it and jammed it into the middle of the restaurant for us to sit in. Pino then literally threw our menu's at us, and walked away. Not so much as a free drink for our inconvenience.

The food is still good here, but I refuse to give my money to someone who CLEARLY does not appreciate your business. There are SO many good restaurants in the area, with owners/chefs who are happy to have you.

_vwy7eTm8V5yHw_QxhVDBA,6-rHoGIQn1okWogYCwuSMA,"I went to Pino's to celebrate a friends birthday on a Thursday night.  I hadn't been in Pino's since they renovated, but I have to say that they made the interior beautiful.  We made reservations, but I don't think we would have needed them since there was just a few other parties seated when we came in.  

My two girlfriends and I always have a tough time deciding what to order...so naturally we order one of everything that looks good.  We started with the Charcuterie platter, which was a mix of absolutely delicious prosciutto, capicola, and soppressata with a bit of veggies and mozzarella.  This was an impressive way to start out the meal.  We all wanted to try the seasonal ravioli, which was pumpkin (too tempting for three certified pumpkin fanatics), so we got an order to share as an appetizer.  This was unlike other pumpkin ravioli I've had...very pumpkiny.  The ravioli was good, although we all agreed that we wouldn't have been able to eat a whole order.  It was very sweetly spiced and I was missing a little bit of savory with the dish.  

I ordered the grilled sausage pizza for my entree, and was pleased with it.  I admittedly never get too excited about pizza, and this was good, but nothing that I was dreaming about later that night.  Overall, the food was a 3-4 for me.  

The service was outstanding.  Our waiter was very welcoming and knowledgable.  My friends got dessert, and when the chef (I assume Chef Pino?) came over to ask how it was, my friend jokingly said that it was delicious, but would be perfect with a bit of sauce.  Before she could take another bite, he whisked both of the desserts away and added fresh strawberries and sauce, saying that he would be serving the dish that way for now on.  Talk about service!  The whole experience was fantastic, service gets a 5.  

Added bonus:  Awesome beer selection, some brews I haven't seen.  Only place I've been that had East End Homewood Reserve on tap for me to try (exciting for a beer dork like me, and it is tasty, by the way).",2,ZL6DNzyenFm9Kpz6uADlNg,0,4,2012-01-24,review,4

We decided to come here because it was Pittsburgh restaurant week and they offered a special 3 course $30 fixed price menu with 2 course wine pairing for $12.  It ended up being a small little restaurant in the middle of Point Breeze which I had been past many times previously but never really noticed.

The restaurant was swamped whenever we got there, probably due to a combination of it being Friday night and restaurant week, so thankfully we had made reservations and were seated almost immediately.  I decided to start off my meal with a salad while my girlfriend had the tomato garlic bisque.  My salad was good and came with goat cheese, pears and a vinaigrette which all tasted nicely.  It was nothing amazing but I think it takes a really special salad to be amazing.  I also tried my girlfriends bisque and unsurprisingly found it to be a bit tomato-y since I do not enjoy tomatoes very much but she really enjoyed it.  For my entree I decided to get two small plates instead of a larger entree and settled on the mac n cheese and fish tacos.  The tacos were a bit sloppy/wet but had some nice flavors (cilantro, aoili and pico) in them along with some chili sauce that gave it a nice little kick.  My mac n cheese came out in its own little cast iron type pot and was good.  There was an adequate amount of cheese throughout and I liked that they even had some ricotta buried inside the dish.  I was also able to try the Arrabbita that one of our dining companions had ordered.  Wow was it good and it packed quite the spicy punch too.  Immediately I regretted not ordering it although I still did enjoy my two small plates.  For my dessert course I ended up having the White Chocolate Creme Brulee.  My girlfriend decided upon the tiramisu while another at our table had the peaches and puff pastry.  All of the desserts seemed large and made sure that we did not go home hungry!  My creme brulee tasted decently and ended up being a good finish to my meal.

The bottom line for me is that I would definitely head back here in the future.  Their regular menu seemed reasonably priced and everything that I had tried throughout the night was good.",0,ZL6DNzyenFm9Kpz6uADlNg,0,4,2012-08-21,review,0

I could tell thet the guests around me were enjoying themselves as well.

The table decided to order the 3 course menu for 30$ because of the large amount of options. We each decided on a different entree so that we were able to share and get a good idea of all the restaurant has to offer. I started off with a mixed green salad with grileld pears, walnuts and goat cheese. The pears had a nice smokeyness about them that complimented the sweet vinagarette. For my entree, I chose the Arrabiata with rigatoni. The dish was very good but much more spicy than I had expected. I feel that they should have informed me of this or explained the spice level on the menu. Luckily, I enjoy spicy food but I was unable to finish the entree due to the spice level. It was slightly less spicy when I finished it for lunch the next day. My husband had the veal and risotto which he loved. For dessert, I orderedthe peach mille feuille. The portion size was enormous and the peaches were ripe and tasty. However, the marscapone filling hardly tasted of marscapone. I had the opportunity to try my husband's white chocolate tiramisu and was pleasantly surprised by the light but still rich flavors. Our dinner guests also seemed to enjoy their choices as well.

Then we ordered the octopus which was fine, but very cold and the octopus had little to no flavor, being overwhelmed by the citrus in the dish.

It seems in an effort to create a quaint wine bar, Pinos lost sight of the original draw and that was the food.  The menu has been scaled back considerably.  Though the food was adequate, it's not the same.  I came here because the food was amazing and with that no longer being the case, I doubt we will return.  Hopefully, things will change back to how they were.  Customer advice for what it's worth.  Refocus on great italian food not a wine bar concept.

XAsr0AwCkTV-jJhZJ6Gfeg,b5uL8DiFUUdZhhnNnSEHjw,"I went to Pino's with my three other friends for Restaurant Week and was underwhelmed and completely disappointed. We chose an option for each course of  the very limited Restaurant Week menu. I selected the baked eggplant caprese appetizer, Lazy Man lasagna Florentine and then the panna cotta for dessert. 

Baked eggplant caprese: the breaded eggplant was a soggy mess. 
Lazy Man Lasagna Florentine: it was essentially two huge lasagna noodles sandwiching huge clumps of spinach (I'm talking like a 3-inch high pile of clumped spinach) with a few mushrooms peppered in. The spinach ratio was out of control and I honestly ate a few bites and couldn't even continue. 
Panna cotta: this was the most decent of the items we ordered.

My friend ordered off the regular menu, which she advised not to do since her food would come out at a different time?? Why? 
We tried my friend's appetizer of the Italian Fries, which are described on the menu as sounding very similar to the amazing fries at Point Brugge...but it was just a bowl of regular French fries, which were lackluster and misleading. She also got the house soup with chickpeas and it looked like Spaghetti-o's and tasted even worse.

I don't know where all the positive reviews are coming from. There was not one thing we ate that was impressive in any way. All of it was overpriced and below mediocre. I wasted my money, and I will never, ever go back there.",0,ZL6DNzyenFm9Kpz6uADlNg,0,1,2014-08-14,review,2

I don't have one favorite dish because I usually order one of the specials, which change often. I ordered from the regular menu for the first time a couple of weeks ago. The Bolognese sauce on tagliatelle pasta (I think the menu has it on rigatoni) was as good as what I had in Italy. My son had the seafood risotto. It was so good, I need to order it next time.

My brother is a retired chef and hates to eat out because few restaurants are worth paying for what he can make better at home. He loved his meal and his tastes of everyone else's at the table (there were 10 of us). He was giddy to enjoy eating out for the first time in in a long time.

Oh, they also make great cocktails and have a very, very nice wine list.

Oh, if you think you can only get good fries and mussels at the Belgium place around the corner, try Pino's. The fries are topped with crispy herbs... yum!

BbM64jzOeDBVJWeGNJrF_g,msWzljdrEUlDMglwQdq63g,"I went to Pino's recently, only to be disappointed by the owner himself. I guess I should have read the reviews on here before going, seeing as a lot of people echo the sentiments that I feel.

After my mother sent back her extremely oversalted steak, the chef came out to ""apologize"". It was very embarrassing how he chastised her for not enjoying her meal. He then snidely commented, as walking away, that he would ""never salt his steak again"". I don't really take kindly to people speaking so rudely to my mother. She was very polite about sending it back and certainly didn't deserve any attitude. We had an event to attend, which we were very clear with to our waitress. So when my mother reordered another meal (a salad), which took another twenty minutes, my mom asked for it to be immediately wrapped up. The chef returned, obviously chewing to make a point, and sneered at my mother, announcing her steak that she refused to eat was actually quiet good. Well, I have never felt more embarrassed in a situation. I said he was being rude to my mother, a paying customer. He proceeded to get heated and tell me it was not his job to make people happy (!??!) and that everyone else seemed to enjoy their meal and we just had to get to the inside of the steak to appreciate it. 

The drama continued when he did not have change for $100 for a $57 bill. Sorry, how can you not have $33 in change?! He ended the night by throwing our bill in a crumbled mess on the floor and walking out. 

Overall, embarrassing. It was an embarrassing situation for anyone to witness. Take heed of the negative comments on this site. I certainly wish I would have.",0,ZL6DNzyenFm9Kpz6uADlNg,0,1,2014-10-07,review,5

Very awkward.t.  Salad was average at best.  The beets tasted like canned beets and the chicken was covered with blackish oil from a burnt oil pan.

  Then, to make matters worse the chef came out to argue with a patron who returned her food.  The chef came out to humiliate the customer explaining that her returned steak was great and himself was enjoying it.  Eating food from a customers plate was a real turn-off....what else does he do when cooking? 

To make matters worse, when paying the bill, the chef did not have change for a $100 bill for the customer who returned her steak..  It was very uncomfortable watching the elderly customer and her young friend deal with the situation. He kept  loudly requesting a credit card  and the women did not have one.   Another customer provided them with change as the chef crumbled the check. I think I would have just left and not paid....give the lady great for dealing with such a lunatic.

6rR83Un71x8KWnW9-oJfqA,WeOCls-1J47AFFQpN4kf4w,"This was the place I brought friends visiting from out of town when I wanted to show them the classy Italian  spots in Pittsburgh. After my visit last night, I have no desire to ever go again. 

I don't know the owner, Joe, personally but he has stopped by our table a few times and said ""dish looks beautiful."" He was always confident in his food which I guess is a good thing if the good is delicious,  which it usually is  

The table next to ours had a two women, a mother and daughter. The mother asked the server for a new steak as hers was a bit salty (I've never had the steak as I'm vegetarian but my guests have mentioned the abundance of salt). The server apologizes and returns to the kitchen. The owner comes out and fakes an apology claiming his steaks are perfect. At this point the whole restaurant is listening it's that crazy.  The  best part? He comes out again and says ""I really enjoyed the steak you sent back."" He was eating the steak and had some in his mouth! I can't make stuff like this up!
At this point the whole place feels bad for the mother and daughter. Clearly an awkward situation. The owner got so nasty the daughter tried to reason with him and he said ""it's not my job to make people happy"" that's strange considering he wants our business. 
So the mother tries to pay the bill with a $100 and leave but he said they can't make change. Eventually another customer helps make change and they leave.

The prices in the high $20's for most of the entrees are not justified by the quality, location, or portions.  The food is essentially slightly hipper Olive Garden fare at double the prices.

For dinner entrees you can get more for your money elsewhere.  But it's not all bad.  The atmosphere is pleasant and the service was excellent.  I had a good time and I'd happily go back for appetizers (most are $8-10).

Pino's is frequented by a large rambunctious flock of malbec massacring 40-50 year old women.  My friend and I were the only males there.  If cougar hunting is your sport of choice, you'll feel right at home in Pino's jungle safari!",1,ZL6DNzyenFm9Kpz6uADlNg,2,3,2014-11-05,review,0

y9Q2mHM8av_2fiqvvers-Q,Z0qZoFLvIZK_eb_ISAboHg,"Pino's is an mid-level Italian place with a charming neighborhood atmosphere. The prices aren't the cheapest, but for what it is Pino's delivers small plates and dinners that are satisfying without breaking the bank. The lamb bolognese is one of my personal favorites, as well as pretty much any of the appetizers. I also love the creative cocktail list and the half price bottles of wine for happy hour. There are few places in Pittsburgh that can get me as excited about cocktails as Pino's. My roommate and I have come here with friends and sat at the bar for hours eating and drinking a variety of delightful things. In short, they do drinks and food quite well for the price. 

The reason Pino's only gets three stars is the unfortunate inconsistency with service I've encountered. I get treated differently depending on who I come in with, and that's unprofessional. If I'm with my roommate and one of my friends (both of whom work nearby) we all get seated quickly and treated extremely well. In short, it feels like my presence is valued. When I've come to Pino's with people who aren't in with the owners though, I've had a thoroughly lackluster experience. Once I came on my birthday with my boyfriend and frankly was let down. We waited awkwardly for a very long time to be seated even though there were empty tables and in general had a very impersonal experience.

Bway said everything was fine front and rear and just charged me for inspection.

You know that a trip to a large, ""one size fits all"" chain grocery store like this is not quite the same as shopping at Macy's or Boscov's.

HSmUfXQYjF9_pql4jfF_Gw,8D45qGrqu1kqNrHwbFBcog,"I have to agree that this is one of the poor examples that Giant Eagle has.  Granted, it has the basics you need, and is 1 of the biggest in the city itself.  Finding things takes work.  My big gripe is that it has one of the weirdest and most illogical layouts that I've seen.  It actually takes time to find what you need as compared to most stores where once you are in there a few times, you easily find everything.  Parts of this store are diagonal and that causes you to go in every direction possible.  Here is a quick summary of the setup as it can be classified as a maze:

1.) When you enter the store through the slow wide door, you go to the left and walk past the front registers to produce.  Normal enough.

2.) From produce in front of you (a quasi L-shaped department), you take a quick left and go diagonally to the right to walk past the pharmacy.  Take a hard right down aisle 1 and then you hit the bakery.   

3.)  From the bakery, you walk along a long meat wall.  Diagonally to the left, you'll find the service meat/seafood counters. And because how the wall goes diagonal to the left, the sign for Aisle 9 is facing diagonally to the right so you don't miss it because the 1 side is longer towards the back than the other. (Aisles 9-14 are almost twice as long as 1-8).

4.) From meat, you have frozen straight back on a long back wall in its own cove.  A hard right (if you bypass frozen) brings you last to hot foods, the deli, and then facing in front of you, the Customer Service desk which is tucked away in a corner (not really visible when you walk in the store).

5.) Once you pass the deli and customer service, take a hard right, then to the left (almost a U-turn) to the checkouts, and then you take a hard left to leave.

Most of the other Giant Eagle stores are much more logical in how their aisles and deparment locations are set up.   You're not going every which way to try and find things.

Also, the service isn't that great as one of the other reviews said.  Given that, I would take Market District on Centre Ave or GE on Murray Ave over this store.

However, for those who remember the Giant Eagle on Centre Ave at N. Craig St, nothing beats how BAD that store was.  There is a reason that store was nicknamed ""the dirty bird.""

From the moment you walk into here it's like someone has hit you on the head very hard and you walk around in a confused state the rest of the time you're in there.

The set up is ridiculous.  I mean, who wants to walk around in the freezer section and then go through a smaller than usual end of the aisle to see, SURPRISE, the meat section hidden off in an area where they could have knocked down the wall so you didn't have to do a little dance to get to it.  Aisles seem extra long in this store, you can tell that they worked with the space they had.  It's like when you are half way through the aisle and realize it's too late to turn around because it's the same distance to the end as it was to the beginning of the aisle, but you kind of just want to give up and sit on the floor because you feel like you've been walking forever.

JWtFuKaFXn_l5h-qKZWZuQ,hlgeTvjVY2Vl0xEMpyRhBA,"Terrible! I got a haircut here once and hated it, but kept waiting for it to settle in after a few washes. It never did look right, so I just fixed it at home rather than going back to these incompetent people. I didn't even feel like the hassle of complaining was worth it, as I highly doubted that I'd get any money refunded and I certainly didn't want them to touch my hair again to try to fix it. 

I then figured, hey, this place sucks for haircuts but they can't mess up eyebrow waxing, right? Right! But their service is so bad that I gave up on that too -- I got my eyebrows done here a few times with not much trouble, but the last time I went in, I had called ahead to put my name in and was told that I would be next on the list, and to show up in about 20 min. My house is a 20 min walk from there, perfect! I headed out, got there in 20 min, and gave the woman at the desk my name and reminded her I'd called ahead. There was one man sitting there waiting, who I had seen from across the street walking in about 1 min ahead of me. 

The ""stylist"" was just finishing up a haircut, so I should have been next, right, since I had put my name in before the guy who walked in? Nope! She called him over and I said ""sorry, I think I was next, I called ahead and was told I'd be next in line"" and the lady said ""oh we don't do that."" WTF?? You told me very clearly that you do exactly that, what craziness is this? So I waited, figuring that I'd already invested 20 min into this venture, so I may as well stick it out. 

And waited, and waited, while one ""stylist"" cut the man's hair and 2 of them chatted in the back (ironically next to the chair where they do facial waxing). They must have been ""on break,"" or maybe just terribly rude and idiotic, because I sat there waiting for another full 20 min, and when I finally spoke up again to ask when someone would be available to do my eyebrows. The 2 chatty cathies in the back looked over, very annoyed at my presence, and the woman doing the haircut said ""after I'm done here,"" and I sat there incredulous for another 2 minutes before getting up and leaving.

vyMz5dlMmUYzcsynkiW_ZQ,FamyBFnuAaViJI9t0JJflw,"I used to cut my own hair, haphazardly, with a pair of Andis clippers.  Once, due to a series of unfortunate events, I ended up needing a new passport photo the day I cut my hair.  I hadn't realized quite how much of a goob I looked like.  Since I was going from free to paying for haircuts, I chose a Supercuts, and it was better than I did for myself.

Periodically I'm burned by a supercut, but what I've learned is that if you know what you want and tell the cutter how to do it, things generally turn out alright, and I've been going to this location since I moved to Pittsburgh and have never had a bad experience.

The Supercuts I used to go to in Boston was renovated with a spa-feel.  Mostly that meant new seating, and heated-massage chairs at the sinks where they do shampoos.  Not the case in Shadyside.  It's in a stripmall, and everything is kind of dated.  The only ""spa"" treatment they have is the tea tree experience: you get a bit of a hot towel face massage and special tingly tea tree shampoo.  Some of the cutters will spend several minutes on this, while others finish so fast it seems like they have an aversion to scalp-contact.  It's hit or miss in terms of the amount of time they spend, but for $5 that's a risk I'm willing to take.  Of course you can do the same for yourself with a little Dr. Bronner's, but after letting someone operate sharp machinery near my face, sometimes I want to be pampered just a bit.

So far, while some have been better than others, I've never had an embarrassing cut at this location, and if you're a dude with short hair, you can be in and out during your lunch break at work for $30 (or about $20 if you don't want the shampoo).",0,rM-yscH8mBLYvpWnmvuPMw,1,3,2015-01-04,review,1

Zff7xm0J-C7hV1z3j-JipQ,ICfB48LBct5Q1AU_5bz5WA,"As a chinese american college student from NYC who got stuck in Pittsburgh with its useless public transportation (circa 1998), I desperately missed home-style Chinese food for the better part of my first two years here. Things turned around for me once I got a car (or made friends with cars), but I was seriously hurting for a while.

Tasty was one of the places we found. Back in the day, it was owned and ran by a typical restaurant-owning Chinese family. They had the works - pushy lao ban niang (boss lady), chef slash dad, and, during school off-hours, junior high school daughter manning the cashier. If they were in NYC, they'd only be missing an ami.... a bus boy. The food was pretty good, and if you order in Chinese, the lao ban niang hooked you up with extras because ""your parents teach you good to talk Chineees"". 

I'm pretty sure Tasty is under new ownership now. The food isn't as good as it was, but the restaurant still gives off the home-style look and feel. It's a small restaurant with enough seating for about 25-30 patrons. Cheap tables, cheap seats; after all, restaurant extras are just a waste of money. The customers should come back for the food, this *is* a restaurant.

The new waitress is not friendly, but she gets the job done. The food is still good - so if you're craving a home cooked meal, you'll be somewhat satisfied here. Don't expect grandma's cooking, though. Order the vegetables, the mapo tofu is good, beef/chicken chow fun, etc. They have a lot of other staple items on the menu too. Don't get the salted pork chops - save that craving for Orient Kitchen. Try things, and share your thoughts.

Tasty - it's more than your neighborhood take out joint.

Tasty is another standard chinese takeout place - it didn't blow my mind but overall it was good, especially considering the price. Before I continue, I will come out and say that all of the food was a little tough - the eggroll especially(As was warned) -  and the rice had some dark spots(I assume it was from the bottom of the cooking vessel).  However, I will chalk some of it up to my mistake because I thought they closed a half hour later,  than they did, and consequently ordered about 10 minutes before they closed. So, Tasty, you get a pass on the rice

Anyhow, I ordered a vegetable eggroll($1.50) and general tso's tofu($8.25)(I've learned to accept my guilty pleasure). I ordered the general tso's extra spicy - it was not. Also, the tofu was in very large chunks, which has seemed to be my luck lately. I want surface area, and I don't want to have to figure out how to cut my food with chopsticks. I will say, though, that the sauce was very tasty - enough to seal the deal for a future order at this place.

The eggroll, as I said, was tough.. It tasted good, but it was tough, and small... This probably won't be in my future order, however with the $10 minimum I do need to order something else with my tofu... I hope the soup is good.

The lady behind the counter was friendly and was decent on the phone and didn't once mention that they were closing so close to when I ordered.

If you have an occasion, say a graduation dinner, the restaurant will even roast you a duck (yum!), or stir fry up some lobster with ginger and scallions ( big yum!) or stew you some pork with lotus root soup ( super yum!).

It wasn't spicy like I requested, but the chicken was still crispy after having to drive it home and the sauce was very savory.

I don't know what that sauce was made from but it was disgracing all General Tso's sauce by existing. The egg rolls, a Chinese classic, were so dark and hard, I'm not sure how we could have possibly eaten them. The Crab Rangoon's... Generally these are my favorite thing at a Chinese restaurant. I'm not sure what they think they are attempting to pass for Crab Rangoon's here. These monstrosities were completely inedible. 

The only thing they didn't mess up on our order was the rice. It tasted and looked like rice. When we called to complain I was told the restaurant said they did nothing wrong and wouldn't do anything about the situation. Awesome. Now my stomach is upset from the few bites I took.

I'm pretty sure this place should change it's name to ""Inedible Slop"" because it's far from ""Tasty.""",0,Y2p07YEC8xOsYTHWf0UxiA,0,1,2015-03-17,review,0

Unfortunately a great deal of what is on their regular menu and with the delivery services is comprised of the American version  of Chinese food.The first time I came to this place they only gave me the American iced menu.But having lived in the Bay Area for many years I scoped out the Hong Kong style menu and vowed to order from it the next time I went to Tasty and I did.Now I just  pick up the Hong Kong menu automatically when I come in.Their Hong Kong dishes are some of the best I've had in Pittsburgh.The garlic eggplant in a velvety sauce combines the right hint of spiciness with sweet and virtually melts in your mouth.The salted squid (what's usually known as salt and pepper squid) has a light, crispy coating with a minimum of oil and the texture of the squid is
just a tiny bit chewy but not too much so.Texture in squid is a daunting thing to get just right.I am a Chow Fun freak anyway  but their shrimp chow fun with egg sauce is the best I've ever tasted with slightly charred noodles fresh dhrimp and a wonderful egg scramble sauce . Recently I had a friend visiting from San Francisco and took him here (kind of a test to see if my view of this place was somehow off) and he raved about everything especially this chow fun dish.To sum up,if you want to experience the best of Tasty please order from the Hong Kong menu.Since. I don't order American Chinese dishes here I can't comment on them but I guess the genius of this place is authentic South Chinese dishes (as evidenced by the Chinese families I've seen eating here) not the usual  pseudo Chinese dishes many people seem to order here.I expect the chef/cook here just doesn't have his heart in Crab Rangoon or chow mein.",0,Y2p07YEC8xOsYTHWf0UxiA,1,4,2015-07-31,review,1

General tso's - pretty good. It's spicy like I requested. Sauce was all at the bottom, just needed a stir. Chicken was cooked nearly perfect, some a little chewy but better than the normal weird and slimy chicken you get. Sauce is really good.

I'll preface this with how kind the ""owner""was. Very kind, gave me minor changes without question.

Soup first. Zero flavor, zero filling, frozen wan tons? If not, which I highly doubt, whomever made them should quit or be fired. They most certainly sat in broth for hours. I couldn't even pick them up. They fell apart. 

Veg second. Fresh vegetables, thanks for that. Again no effing flavor. Watery sauce, no heat. Just bad. 

And finally. The worst part of it all. Singapore chow fun. This is a curry based thin noodle dish. The curry was obviously burnt in the pan or wok before anything else was mixed into it. See pics of giant balls of noodles that tasted like the burnt curry. Not sure if this is from everyone else in this area ordering the typical American garbage Chinese food and they don't make it often, or what.

Vento's is located in the East Liberty section of Pittsburgh right next to Home Depot. They have been in business forever! They are a pizza and hoagie shop. They are famous for their Italian Army hoagie. I have friends that as soon as they land in Pittsburgh they come straight to Vento's for the pizza! It is Sicilian style pizza and It is delicious! Everything is made fresh so sometimes you have to wait a little while for your food. It's best to call ahead if you're really hungry.

You can already tell how bad your experience is going to be when they give you the complimentary bread that looked like it was bought from a convenience store. Not the crusty Italian bread. The generic Giant Eagle whole wheat bread that I buy regularly tasted 10x better. This so-called Italian bread came with pre-packed airline butter. No dipping oil with herbs and spices. Then we had the wedding soup which looked like it's been sitting in the kitchen since this morning and was just reheated. 

We had the appetizer platter, which was composed of allegedly banana peppers, calamari, and breaded zucchini. It was 95% breading. I can barely taste any calamari or zucchini. The worst was the marinara sauce, which tasted like it came from a can. Again, no herbs and spices. 

For the entree, I ordered rigatoni and my fiance had baked ziti. The only way I can describe the sauce is: Think of diluted Ragu. My pasta was also overcooked and there was no flavor whatsoever so I had to put so much parmesan cheese. I couldn't even taste garlic in it. What kind of Italian food has no garlic? The baked ziti was overcooked and dry, and it was tasteless according to my fiance. 

Service was slow, but there was only one waitress in the restaurant. I requested warm water and it took about 40 minutes until she finally served it. She was generally nice and probably embarrassed for serving such crappy food.

3) The parking lot itself is pitted and dangerous, even by Pittsburgh Pothole standards.

4) This place is ghetto. This is the place all of the thugs and gangsters come to get their Slim Jims and ""hang out"". People paid for things in nickles and pennies.

That was my first experience at the store. My second experience (months later -- I blame a lapse in memory) found me driving down Baum and thinking ""hey, I could use gas and my car is crazy dirty. I wonder how much that Shell place's car wash is? It won't be so bad if I never have to go inside the store."" 

So I google-texted real quick and called them. After 8 rings someone picked up the phone and mumbled at me. I cheerfully asked how much the car wash was.
 
-""We can't give that information over the phone"". 
--""Wait, what!? Why not?"" ""I just want to know to compare it to Getgo's, which is $7"". -""Sorry."" 
--""Well that's stupid; let the manager know I think he's an idiot."" 
-""Sure"". Click.

Because of their popularity most of their work is repairs via insurance companies. Their new building is fantastic and their staff is nice and professional. They are also a Geico auto repair X-press shop and have Enterprise car rental representatives on site to make a rental car easy and hassle free.

On their website they do provide updated pictures and status as to your repair. I did find this not updated as fast as my car was done before it stated online. No big deal though.

One thing I wanted to mention is that out of the 3 repair places that I got estimates, Mike's Auto Body was the only place that decided it would be cost effective to replace the fender sheet metal instead of trying to pound out, bondo and sand the old damaged fender. I was thankful for the decision they made.

They also cleaned my car inside and out, put in paper floor mats, gave complimentary glass cleaner and a little goody bag for when I picked up my car.

It is a shame they don't do full body paint because I know they would do a great job if they did.

I highly recommend them to anybody. Their location is not in such a bad area at all. I am not too far from the Pittsburgh Zoo and it was only minutes away.

BnBVuJgAUMm6dZQlSba8dg,ZzqIKc2HW1qp73fqGFnlyg,"This is an animal shelter with a tremendous heart. While I realize it's more popular to back the more selective (aka ""no-kill"") shelters around Pittsburgh, the ""open door"" policy places the ARL at the top of my list. Where the so-called no-kill shelters can afford to be choosy and accept all-star pets, the ARL will accept any pet, from a private owner, someone who finds a stray, or even the city's animal control. A small, over-extended staff collaborates with a dedicated troop of volunteers, and manages to adopt thousands and thousands of pets each year into family homes. 

I have adopted two cats from this shelter, and also participated in the adoption of several friends' pets here, too. The paid staff can be spread a little thin, especially if you come on a Friday afternoon/evening, or a weekend morning. Guess what, lots of people want to adopt a pet on the weekend when they have extra time to help it settle in. So don't be surprised to find crowds of potential adopters and exhausted staff!!! For a quieter experience, try a weekday. For the most intimate pet-finding experience, go during a Steelers game. Seriously, you will have the place to yourself. 

Is it sacrilegious to tell you to do anything during a Steelers game? Whoops. 

The ARL lists some of their pets on Petfinder, but I have found that the selection on the adoption floor is often too vast & quick moving for them to keep the profiles online updated -- what I'm trying to get at is this: Don't get super attached to a pet online, because there's a reasonable chance it already has a home. And don't avoid a trip because you don't see anyone you like online. There are more future fur-friends waiting for you at the shelter. 

The staff of volunteers is extraordinary - I adopted one of my cats directly out of a foster home, and the volunteer must have gone out of her way to come to the shelter at my convenience and explain all the in-home habits of my future baby. I had such a positive experience with her, and the shelter. They invite you to send updates and pictures as your new pet adjusts. Yes, the staff & volunteers have a vested interest in the pets and want to know how things go! 

The rates for adoption vary, depending on the season, so if your finances require some help to acquire your new best friend, keep an eye on their website for info about ""sales."" You can also donate old sheets, towels, pet carriers, and toys for the animals who stay here on their way to permanent homes. I donate a big pile of worn towels and sheets every time i sort my linen closet. They also accept ca$h donations to help keep up with expenses. 

Maybe I seem like an over-enthusiastic cheerleader of this place, but the fact is that this organization connected me with two very important cats in my life, and every scratch on my arms, every litter box, and every fur-covered outfit in my life is due credit to their tireless efforts.

nEYPahVwXGD2Pjvgkm7QqQ,P5ydJhKAjhhNYDl9yTBMLg,"I'm a crazy cat lady and proud of it! 

Being a volunteer here has been so fulfilling on many different levels.  It has made me feel so good to be able to help out with something that I feel passionately about.  You can tell that the staff puts a lot of effort into taking care of these animals they accept in.  A lot of times people will say, oh I can't do it, it's too sad.  But the thing is, it's not.  It's actually so great because these animals come here and find loving homes instead of being on the street or in an environment that's toxic.  I rarely see animals there for a long time.  I think that's a testament to the way they are treated while they're in the facility. 

Now I'll admit, I'm not the biggest dog fan, so I help out in the cat shelter.  I can talk about that with a lot more knowledge than the dog side.  They just built a new cat facility on their property so they have their own shelter.  The cats are all set up in a huge room.  They have two rooms for people to play with the cats when they are looking to adopt them.  These rooms are also used for ""cat cuddling.""  That's what I do when I volunteer.  I get to take the cats out so that they can play, be cuddled or just run around.  Then the cats are able to get out of the cages and get used to human contact. 

The other great thing about the ARL is that they have foster parents who take in cats and dogs while they're waiting to be adopted.  This way, they get a great home environment and it relieves the facility of having too many animals at one time. At different points in the year the adoption rates are different depending on the amount of animals they have.  Cat rates are usually cheaper in the Spring/Summer because there's more coming in and dog rates are cheap in the late summer months.  The added bonus of adopting a pet from the ARL is that they are spade or neutered when you adopt them.  It's actually cheaper then taking them to a normal vet on your own. 

I would STRONGLY recommend coming here to check out the animals and hopefully find your next furry friend!  OR you can volunteer!  They have volunteer informational sessions the first Saturday of every month.  After that you only have one training session to complete and you're ready to volunteer!  

Just check it out if you're curious.  You won't regret it!  Your new furry friends will appreciate it as well!",5,VkFDer80GOrelWALdgNReg,3,5,2011-01-17,review,11

zWli0lD5TNKpTSHjXWdHxA,4EzV9Q8Jn6C9B8YTIESx5w,"Animal Rescue League is great! BUT, I'm very disappointed by their dog trainer/behaviorialist, Lacey. 

I have a large papillon (a ""throwback"", as my vet called him), whose previous owners neglected and undersocialized him for the first two years of his life. As a result, he is now extremely fearful when taken outside the home, and he becomes overstimulated and aggressive. I brought him to one of ARL's Saturday small dog classes, but he freaked out, and we were asked to leave. Lacey said she'd be in contact to set up a private class. 

She called a few days later, and we arranged a private class for 6pm on a Wednesday. I made arrangements to leave work early to drive back into the city and get my pup some help! It's hard to anticipate exactly how much traffic there will be on Fifth Ave during rush hour, so I wound up playing it overly safe and arriving 10 minutes early for our class. 

After a few minutes, Lacey noticed us and came outside to tell me that she was running fifteen minutes behind. I wasn't sure what to do, because I couldn't really go anywhere with my cray-cray dog, and there was too much traffic to go home and come back again. So, she said we could wait inside in a small hallway. 

We went in to wait, and naturally, with all the smells and sounds, my pup got a bit riled up. But, we waited...and waited and waited. At 6:25pm, I knocked on the door to the training room. Silence. So, I opened it. Nobody was there, and the door to the outside was open. I peeked out, and there she was, with the people and dog that had the lesson before me. I waited for a moment, hoping she'd notice me and look at her watch or something, but nope.

So, I took my dog and walked outside to my car. She turned and looked at me, but didn't acknowledge me in any way. I went and sat in my car with my dog for a few minutes, hoping the other folks, their dog, and Lacey would wrap things up, but no. They just continued on. At 6:35pm, I knew I couldn't wait any longer, because I had work I still needed to finish up that had to be done by 9pm. I got out of my car, and began walking towards Lacey. She just stared at me, rather than saying ""We're just finishing up,"" or ""Sorry, I lost track of time,"" or anything at all. So I said, ""We're going to have to reschedule. It's past 6:30 now, and I can't stay past 7."" She simply replied, ""Okay. I'll call you."" 

I thought it was rude and unprofessional to not offer any type of apology, or even a half-hearted explanation, but whatever. No one said she had people skills, I suppose, and this was about getting my dog help! 

Well, it's been a week and a half. No call from Lacey! Needless to say, I'll be finding another, more reliable trainer. I'm just really disappointed, not only in her unprofessionalism, but also her lack of caring about my dog. I barely had any interaction with Lacey, but even if there was something about me she didn't like, she should have cared more about helping a pup that obviously needs it. 

I sincerely hope that others have had better experiences, and I hate to knock even a single star off for ARL -- but this Yelp review seems to be my only way of warning others to seek another trainer for their dog behavioral needs! :(",1,VkFDer80GOrelWALdgNReg,1,3,2012-08-15,review,5

After visiting every shelter in the city and finding nothing, we came back the next day after seeing a posting for a 2 month old terrier mix.

While struggling with my horrific grief and having difficulty getting back into life as I once knew it, my grief counselor suggested that I ""help something else"" in order to help myself feel better.  We decided that since I was an animal lover I would try volunteering at an animal shelter.  I was not working, so I had a lot of time and wanted the shelter to feel right.  I visited a few, they all do good work, but the one that kept drawing me back was the ARL.  Yes, the building is old, it's a bit run down, but that doesn't stop the staff and administration from doing the best they can with so very little and in not the best of space.  I saw a bathroom be ""renovated into a vet tech office, I saw the janitor's closet renovated and made in to the ""rodent room.""  Where cats once lived in cages along the halls of the ARL a new building next door, an old gas station was made into the ""Cat Adoption Center!""  When you have staff that are still young and are going on 5-10 years + at the same shelter, (same place of employment for that matter) you know something about the place is right!  I volunteer easily 30 hours a week at the ARL, I get to see the good, the bad and the ugly, and I can tell you first hand that the good is in the staff, the Executive Director, Dan Rossi, and all of the work that goes on for the animals.  The staff knows EVERY one of the animals, they do all they can to care for them, and keep the doors WIDE open for both domestic and wild animals, even if that means a staff member or volunteer takes a cat or dog home!  The answer is never ever ""no"" to any animal.  I also volunteer for the Humane Society of the United States and travel around the countryside working on dogfighting raids, cruelty, hoarding, natural disasters, and the ARL has never said no to me when I ask to bring animals back from incredibly sad or inhumane situations.  Technically, by the numbers, it is a ""no-kill"" shelter, because it is open door people will often call it a ""kill shelter.""  Yes, sometimes an animal does have to be euthanized.  The ARL is the Animal Control shelter for the city of Pittsburgh and with that can bring some very upsetting and disturbing signs of animal cruelty.  It can also mean it's the dog who just bit a kid that you just saw on the news.  The ARL has an obligation to society to not let dangerous dogs back on the street, to euthanize when a dog is very sick or is very aggressive to humans or other animals, and trust me, I have held many of those dogs as they are put to sleep and I always am so thankful that the vet staff we have are so compassionate and do the euthanasia in the most humane manner.  That's a tough job, it's heartbreaking, but in some cases it has to be done for the good of the animal and for the safety of society.  I admire the work and staff of the ARL and will continue to devote my time to them and thank them for the wonderful work they do on behalf of the city of Pittsburgh and all of the wild and domestic animals alike.

N_cH3QA_eXXmnzz-nzEeKA,Og2JKYHXp6fhSO963u3Wyw,"Please do not adopt any pets from here until they update their standards.  I hate to think of animals living in cages, but...

!! At least two cats adopted from here in September have diagnosed with the herpes virus by the vet, and this is contagious to other cats. !!

AKA, it is likely that the shelter staff is not washing hands between handling pets and they are not testing for a virus that can be fatal in kittens.

I recently adopted a kitten from their shelter--I picked him up from their Pittsburgh Public Market adoption station.  I was told that he had been tested for common feline viruses and up-to-date on vaccinations.  These were both untrue statements.  The kitten has the herpes virus and was not vaccinated against this.  My roommate, who was with me, and I were warned about the upper respiratory infection (URI) that can occur because of this virus and others, but we were not told that he was neither tested nor vaccinated for the herpes virus.  They gave me a paper with his vaccinations, but it was in vet-speak, so I took their word for it. 

Furthermore, the shelter staff put my kitten in my roommate's name mistakenly (and claimed that if we just called in that they would fix this mistake, but then wouldn't), so when he got sick, no one from their clinic would return my calls--I'm guessing this was since I wasn't the owner according to their records.  I had to email them to get a response, which basically said sorry that we didn't return your calls but this is your problem now.  They never apologized for the kitten's health or asked if he was feeling better.  Where's the compassion for the animal?

So now I have a very sick kitten on my hands.  I took him to the Big Easy in Lawrenceville when he stopped eating, and Dr. Ruiz is the best.  She took care of him, but it cost $160 to treat the virus he picked up at the shelter.

The Animal Rescue League shelter/clinic said that it does not and will not cover expenses for this.  After I had already taken him elsewhere, the clinic staff said that they would have given me a discount if I had waited two days to go to their clinic, but who would wait two days while the kitten wouldn't eat??  And now this virus makes him ineligible for pet insurance.  It  will cost hundreds of extra dollars a year to keep him healthy. 

Had I not fallen in love with the little monster, I would have taken him back to another shelter.  That's what the person who adopted the other kitten with virus did.  Whenever he gets an outbreak, he will get another URI.  This means a lethargic cat who sneezes, gags, and coughs because he can't breathe and who won't eat because he's too congested to smell his food.  It's very sad--protect your cats with the herpes vaccination, please!

Oh, and in case you were wondering: just like in humans, cat herpes is fo' life.  Poor little guy.  This also ruins my plan of getting another cat in the future.  Bad shelter!",1,VkFDer80GOrelWALdgNReg,1,1,2012-10-29,review,8

Shortly after the adoption, I received emails from a volunteer to check in and to inquire about how the dog and I were adjusting.  A few months after the adoption, it became clear that the dog had some pretty serious anxiety and behavioral issues (please note that there is no way the shelter staff could have known about the issues while the dog was in the shelter).  I contacted the shelter and they practically  bent over backwards to help me with the dog's issues.  The dog and I participated in two sessions of behavioral classes (Lacey is wonderful and never gave up on my dog!), consulted with veterinary staff, and received constant emails from staff offering suggestions and checking in to see how I was doing.  In the end, I learned how to manage the dog's behaviors and I love the dog dearly.  Nine months later, I still receive emails from the shelter asking about the dog and offering more suggestions.

I would highy suggest adopting from this shelter.  I understand that my dog is sort of a worse-case-senerio of adopting a pre-owned dog; however, this shelter will make sure you are happy with your adoption and literally will do everything in their power to ensure both you and the adopted animal are ok.

While browsing Facebook, I noticed that they were having an event at ARL.  This particular event was called the Free Fur All.  The event involved free adoption to qualified adopters, free micro-chipping for any pet (adopted there or elsewhere), free dog baths, and goodies for both human and furry companions.

I had plans to get Little Man E microchipped during his appointment to take his manhood away (don't worry, we've talked about it and he is fine by it), but when this popped up and said it was free.  Hot damn, you know I was in line.  It's also probably one of the more easy and humane ways to keep ties on your dog or cat just in case they were to run off one night.

Once we were registered, we waited at most for 15 minutes.  It's a very quick thing to have done.  Little Man E didn't even flinch.  He was more amused by his reflection in the table than that little pinch behind the shoulder blade.  I have to give huge kudos to the staff there.  They are so very friendly to not only you, but your pet.  It's like they talk their language.  I also have to thank them because while we were there, LME somehow ripped his one toenail and they were kind enough to clip as much of it off as they could (no extra charge either!).

Once done, we just walked outside to see what was up (E skipped the bath).  We visited one of the tables and E selected a ball and bandanna and we decided to head out after that.

I think this place is a necessity for the city, and their open-door policy ensures no one will be turned away, saving thousands of animals, but their staff members are some of the most unprofessional and RUDE people I've ever met. When they say that no animal will be euthanized unless it has a health or behavior issue, believe that 'behavior' is a very broad term.  In their own words,  ""Any animal that doesn't tolerate, and also welcome, handling by strangers will be euthanized"".  I found this out when I fostered 5 kittens, and all of the 7 week old kittens were to be put down because they were 'fussy'.  What the hell kitten isn't fussy?!!!! They're curious little guys that want down to explore! 
 When I took the kittens in to offer up for adoption, the exam room was right next to a room full of barking and howling dogs.  There was a girl back there howling at the top of her lungs and laughing, I guess she thought it was funny that the dogs were so terrified and distressed?  The tech handled the kittens (that were terrified because of all the noise) very roughly, and shoved them back into the crate, injuring one of them.  When one of the kittens tried to stop herself from being shoved in the crate, it scratched her, and she became very angry, telling me they would all be euthanized for acting this way!  Luckily, the volunteers must have handled them and helped to calm them, because they were able to offer 2 them up for adoption.  If it wasn't for the volunteers, that place would be a hellhole for all those poor babies.
.
When I took one of the kittens that I ended up adopting (to save them from certain death) to be spayed, the extremely rude tech handed her to me in a box to take home.  After an hour and a half drive home, I opened the box to find my kitten wrapped so tightly in a towel she couldn't move, and she had another towel around her face so tight she couldn't breathe!  I was never so angry in my life!  I don't care how rude you are to me, but do not take it out on the animals!  The poor baby probably hissed or scratched at the tech, so the tech decided to protect herself from the vicious 2 pound kitten by immobilizing her.  

I am now fostering 2 kittens from them that are very sick.  They told me they do better getting well in a home,  Well no doubt, when I got them home, they were FILTHY,  with feces all over their backside, and they weigh less than they did 2 weeks ago when I took them there.  when I asked the 'vet tech' what kind of food they fed them, she said, 'Oh it doesn't matter'.  It most definitely does matter!  Suddenly changing an animals food causes gastic distress, vomiting and diarrhea.  Even the cheapest bag of pet food will tell you that.  That's probably how they got so sick!  I'm actually afraid to complain to anyone until the cats I fostered are adopted, I'm terrified they will hurt the kittens!

I hate to say, ""Don't go here, don't take your animals here"", because then only the animals suffer!  But if you have a bad experience, get names, and write the managers and CEO, and let them know specifics.  Hopefully getting the wrong people out of there.

c21h7JdI1wuzFb2EByAAMw,zj_GhdaaC3f3IaSpvpH0TQ,"Although I aplaud the Western Pennsylvania Animal Rescue League for the services they provide including their Vaccine Clinic, I'm VERY dissapointed by the preferential treatment given to some individuals. 

For those unfamiliar with the vaccine clinic, it is first come, first serve. Many of us get here more than an hour before the clinic starts and wait in line. For those of us who have not as well behaved animals, we tag team it and have one person stand in line while the other stays somewhere off to the side with the animal.

However, on the July Clinic, one lady claimed to be first because she told a volunteer that she needed to stay in the car with her mom instead of waiting in line. Then when the paperwork was being passed out and those of us in line expressed the fact that she did not stand in line, some of us even having a picture of those of us in line, she repeated the fact that she has an elderly mom. When that didn't suffice, she said she had an agressive dog. While I understand that agressive dogs should not be in close proximity to other animals or humans which they could harm, that doesnt stop others who have less friendly animals to still stand in line and control our pets or have another member of the family stand in line on our behalf. For the ARL to let both individuals and their ""agressive"" dog sit in the car and be taken first is unfair to the rest of the participants. What is even more concerning is that this ""agressive"" dog was allowed to sit in the waiting room for 21 minutes with 10 other owners and their pets, some of us which had more than one pet. If this truely was a case of an agressive animal, then the ARL did a disservice to its first 10 Vaccine Clinic participants who were in the waiting room. In addition, the release form states that agressive animals will not be tollerated. 

It would be one thing if this was a one off, but then someone came in claiming to have an apt for a vaccine booster at 930 even though they don't schedule appointments on Sundays except for SPAY day, and they took him!

If any one knows what I need to do or say to get preferential treatment in the future, please let me know! I get that this is a low cost clinic where the services are provided at cost and I greatly appreciate  that because it helps me care for my animals and the rescues we have at a reasonable cost. However, I shouldn't be punished or forced to wait because others cannot follow directions. It would have been a different story if the preferential treatment was because of medical emergency, but they won't.

ARL, please keep up the great services you provide, but also please be mindful of ALL of your patients.

Thanks,
A loving pet owner.",0,VkFDer80GOrelWALdgNReg,0,3,2015-07-05,review,3

It was a wonderful experience. The volunteers were very helpful. We were holding kittens in the kitten room, but the one we seemed to really like was very nervous. They allowed us to take her into another room, and checked on us numerous times.
They were extremely busy and short-staffed, but efforts were still made to make sure we were able to bond with the kitten. They weren't pushy, and they were very patient.

Once we made our decision to adopt, they whisked us over to the main building. The whole process took about 20 minutes. The staff really cares about the well being of their animals. It's great place!",0,VkFDer80GOrelWALdgNReg,0,5,2015-07-27,review,2

I spent $2000 dollars getting her healthy, and got kick out of my apartment which didn't allow pets. Then spent another $1000 dollars when she got a punchured lung at a dog park . This, all for a dog I found in the woods. Do you really thing I'm going to lock it in a car to die? Am I really a villian?

First, my parents love their little seven pound dog, but getting a small dog here is exceptionally difficult.  You need to be prepared to go in at opening and take the dog home that day.  They will only place a 24 hours hold on the animal, and many people coming in here want small dogs.  There was a LOT of heartbreak before finally landing a dog.

Second, there seems to be a lot of oversights.  My parents' dog wasn't properly vaccinated, which is really concerning.  The poor baby had really severe kennel cough as well, and he was sick for well over two weeks after adoption.  They had balls and things in the playrooms that the dogs share, which spreads disease.  :(

I think with some proper training and/or change, this place could fulfill its mission even better.  The good news is that after looking at their 990s, they seem to have successful financial management so this is easily possible.  Well... unless you count the fact that they haven't turned a 990 in the IRS in 2 years according to GuideStar.

I was able to meet and greet with the cat that I was looking to adopt, and spend some time with him in a secluded play area. His foster was there to ask some questions about what I was looking for in a cat and if I had any experience with cat care. All pretty standard for what you should expect before rescuing a new family member. 

The adoption process was super easy, the paperwork was standard and nothing intrusive or out of the ordinary. The adoption counselors were very thorough with the paperwork and answered any and all questions I had about my kitty's health and history.

It really seems like they're trying to do the best with what they've got. I love how non-judgmental they are. They make you answer questions, but nothing that seems too crazy. Their adoption fees are reasonable, and I think it's wonderful how they just give you a leash and let you take dogs that you're considering on a walk.

slfhnRbzoY8W5SkxkTo9GA,WcweFWKWvd6OWuCYumZpMg,"First of all, the alterations themselves were well done. Had to get two coats taken in with recent weight loss, and he did a great job with that aspect. So I have no gripe with the tailoring itself.

However...

1. To take in one full suit and one blazer, he charged $345!!! I understand that it was a decent amount of work, but I've never in my life paid that much for alterations. I have also been told by two other professionals in the clothing industry that he's the most expensive guy in town. So beware, you are paying to dollar! I was in a time crunch, so paid anyways.

2. My suit coat came back ruined! Once again, honest story here. I almost always keep a pack of gum in my inner chest pocket, something I have done for years. I hadn't worn this suit for some time (hence the need to alter), and apparently there was a pack in this one. When I got the suit home to try on, I immediately noticed the whole liner on that side of the jacket was starchy and stiff, and I had never noticed this before. At that point, I hadn't put two and two together yet. I thought maybe they had melted the silk liner during dry cleaning or something. So I went back first thing the next day, and showed the tailor. I figured liability was just on them for botching the cleaning, so all I wanted was for it to be fixed. His ony response was ""you never noticed before? It came in like that."" I had never felt it in my life, but didnt have any other response so just left. Once I started thinking about it again, I had felt the gum when trying on at home before I took it in the first time. So it most definitely happened during the dry cleaning process, as was confirmed by the new cleaner to whom I was referred to fix. If he would have owned up and apologized, it's not even a matter of money to me, but more of honesty.

Also, a lot of stuff is locked behind panels that you need the employees to unlock.  Like, razor blades.  And body wash.  BODY WASH?

hiJLbMIDMe8k1i4VReXEvA,Gsk5f1NoBG-mEt6wN-ufSg,"Never again. Let me repeat, never again. 

The primary reason I used to visit this store was to fill medical prescriptions. Due to their repeated inability and ineptness in fulfilling simple requests, I cannot continue to patronize this store.

Walking into the store, you are given the stink-eye by a minimum wage security guard, which automatically gives you as a customer the warm and fuzzy ""guilty-until-proven guilty"" feeling a shoplifter would get, which is what this store assumes everyone is based upon their decision to lock up the mouthwash and shampoo.

The pharmacy seems to be staffed by high school interns.  They have no concept of customer service, nor do they display any attention to detail, which is quite frankly frightening in a pharmacy.  I really think my chihuahua would make a better pharmacist than the people who work here - my chihuahua lick you to death before you got your prescriptions, but at least you'd get greeted when you approach the counter, and you'd get what you ask for.

The first mishap was when my wife and I changed prescription insurance providers.  i handed wanna-be pharmacist #1 my new insurance card.  After spending about 5 minutes staring into a computer screen behind the counter, he assured me that they had my insurance information in the computer.  I then returned in the following days to fill a prescription, trusting in what wanna-be pharmacist #1 had told me in the days prior.  When I went to check out the bill came to over $300, which I chalked up ""maybe I have to meet a deductible before the coverage kicks in.""  Upon further research, we discovered that wanna-be pharmacist #1 had NOT updated my insurance information and had run the numerous prescriptions I filled under my old insurance.

The latest of many ""adventures"" involved my wife calling in a prescription refill.  We stopped to pick it up on the way home from work, only to be told when we arrived that the insurance won't cover the refill until tomorrow.  Again, she CALLED and SPOKE to one of them to refill the prescription before showing up.  I guess it's too much to ask to TELL someone you're speaking to on the phone that they need to wait a day for the insurance to work before coming into a ghetto pharmacy to not pick up a prescription.  But hey, at least wanna-be pharmacist #2 behind the counter was dressed like a stripper, which gave me and my wife some comic relief for the moment.  

We then returned the following day to (again) pick up the prescription we called to have refilled 2 days prior.  We were first told by wanna-be pharmacist #3 that there weren't any prescriptions waiting for us.  After searching around for a few minutes, they ""found"" my wife's prescription refill, but it would take 10 minutes to be ready.  Yes, the prescription that we tried to pick up yesterday would need another 10 minutes to be prepared.  Hence, I am now here, writing this review.

The few mishaps that happened within the apt ( a broken lock, a leaking sink) were fixed within 24 hours of calling our landlord, Rocco. I have to say that for two girls who forget the little things (more of ten than not) we could not have asked for more understanding tenants for the amount of times we were locked out, forgot keys, needed a drawer fixed, needed heat, etc. Our space was clean and everyone in the building was friendly and respectful.

I took a tour of the place.  I was hopeful the cat smell would be addressed but when the guy said ""Oh, you can smell that?"" I should have known then.  The apartment needed painted--badly, but I was willing to deal so that the stress of relocation could go away.  The unit also had no window treatments, no air conditioning, and did I mention the cat smells?  

On a Friday, I told them I was interested in the apartment, they told me to mail my security deposit check that day.  I followed direction and mailed it.  I made plans for moving.  They never called to tell me my rent check wasn't recieved on Saturday or the following Monday.  I had to email them to request a copy of my lease when I was told  ""The apartment is no longer available, someone came in today and gave a security deposit"".  Interesting--so when I asked the office that past Friday they told me not to bring in my check--that mail would suffice.  Something doesn't sound right here.  Their lack of communication also cost me an additional $100 in non-refundable moving expenses as I had put down a deposit with a moving company.

ftiAX5vlb42APSH8ixdqqw,ZxNIHuiZFsPXngL1nnxEtw,"On my recent road trip from Dallas to New Haven, CT, Randy S. and I stopped in Pittsburgh to revel in its charms. This, I must add, was in opposition to his mother's strong protests to the effect of, ""There's nothing *in* Pittsburgh, why would anyone go there?"" 

Tazza D'oro is the answer to that question. Especially if you like coffee. This is easily one of the best coffee shops east of the Mississippi, and I've been to a lot of them. So, what's so good about it?

Let's go in order of importance:

Coffee - It is really, really good. They use Batdorf and Bronson beans, where an ex-gf of mine used to work in Olympia. Believe me when I tell you that B&B is good. It's not amazingly great, but it's very solid and they take roasting seriously. When I go to a new coffee place I suspect might be good I always get a latte. Why? This one has a high upside if done well and the lowest downside (lots of milk) if done poorly. I got a latte. They have a few sizes, 12oz was the first one I got. It was fantastic. They did a nice little rosetta in it too (look up latte art on google if you have no idea what this is). The baristo really knew what he was doing and pulled a some good shots with excellent crema. 

The coffee was so good (coffee is supposed to taste bold, smooth and rich, which it almost never does and this place had it down) I had to go back for an 8oz, which is another level of trust. It has the same amount of coffee but less milk to hide poor coffee quality. It was always superior. 

This is a coffee place that is truly top notch based on the coffee alone, but there was more. 

Pastries - They all looked amazing. I had a plain donut while I waited in line. Normally I don't eat plain donuts, because life is too short for plain donuts, but it was really, very good. Everyone was commenting on how nice the pastries were.

Atmosphere - This place has it exactly right. It's a mom & pop feel, nothing forced. Some tables, outdoor seating, maybe some local art, but not in a goofy sort of way. Very friendly employees. Just a complete home run. 

Obviously I loved it. Behind me in line for my re-up, I heard a girl behind me in line complain, ""we could just go to Starbucks, it's cheaper!"" then proceeded to order with sugar free syrups and skim milk. That's fine. Everyone has to do what they like... and with the proliferation of bad coffee (Starbucks only being guilty of mediocre, though a little bit interesting coffee) over the past 10 years, I don't blame people for being set that way. But the beautiful thing about Tazza D'Oro (cup of gold in Italian) is that--if you let it--it will remind you that you don't need to make your coffee up like a drag queen on Halloween.

Tazza D'Oro stands as a reminder that coffee can be enjoyed in all its naked glory in an awesome setting on a beautiful street and give you a good f'ing reason to go to Pittsburgh.",5,83_p9vIqOq1TUIf3_GD7bA,3,5,2008-05-26,review,8

BnBVuJgAUMm6dZQlSba8dg,gYNmzEjFUYrF2pqcbHkuOQ,"This is one of my two favorite coffeehouses in town. It took me far too long to come around and love Tazza D'oro. A horrible ex of mine loved this place and I admit that this soured me. I regret the time I wasted not going here. The dark wood inside comforts me. The small tables outside are a great place to spend the summer. 

Tazza D'Oro brews Batdorf and Bronson beans (amazing), provides Enrico pastries (amazing) free wireless (amazing) and one of the most talented and friendly staffs I've ever met (amazing). Everyone who works there is *so* nice and *so* good at what they do. 

They have a small menu of local/fresh food that looks amazing, but I have never actually eaten it. The espresso served here is actually better than the average shot served at Batdorf and Bronson locations in Olympia, WA. I talked about this with one of the barristas at TD'o and they were offended - ""we calibrate our machines the same, we use the same beans, the exact same blends and milks and everything, it can't be different."" Sorry, Tazza D'oro, you are better. 

The lines get long on weekend mornings, but they move quickly. There's a sense of community nestled here, just off the ""main drag"" of Highland Park, between Bryant st. and the reservoir. This is where you can pick up your CSA shipment for the week, where multiple weekly bike rides originate, where there are lively discussion groups meeting nearly every day. The percentage of students is low. Like the rest of Pittsburgh, there's a good chance you'll run into someone you know, but generally I see people I like and miss, which is different than the norm in Pittsburgh for me.",1,83_p9vIqOq1TUIf3_GD7bA,0,5,2008-09-14,review,2
Wj_qVEYRdQiRNyskyRGSCg,56Ebv8gNKpb3DT3dHLAhyg,"Do you see how all of the other reviews give this place 5 stars - this place is way more than a 5 star coffee shop.  I am giving all 5 stars to this delightful coffee shop because it is the perfect community coffee shop.  I am slightly saddened that they took out the 2 overstuffed chairs, but they need more tables because people like to come here and people hanging out in their community is a good thing.  It is 11:30 on a Monday morning and the place is almost full - there are always people coming going, getting coffee.

It is a great place to sit and read the paper or to pick up some coffee on your way to some place else.

Enrico's also has become a hub for other community activities - there a a couple of weekly bike groups that meet here.

I love their signature ""bike love"" for all the espresso drink w/ milk. It's fruity, mild, and fragrant. It's addictive! The only thing I have against it is that it has pretty strong caffeine in it, although it tastes super innocent. It's actually almost stronger then any spro blend I've tried.

Yes the staff tends to be the typical hipster, bike-riding sort that so commonly seems to staff indie coffee shops, but they're friendly and unpretentious, so don't hold it against them.  The patrons are almost exclusively college students (anyone else tends to drive by and take their coffee to go), though hipsters are actually in the minority here.  Anyone under the age of 25 will fit in perfectly, and no one 35 and under will feel uncomfortable.  

The noise level is perfect.  Most students are on their laptops with headphones, a few are chatting quietly, and the background (indie) music is just that.  You don't need headphones to concentrate here.

Decor is decent without being great.  The ceiling is crossed by beautiful wooden beams, and the floor is a pleasantly bland creamy ceramic tile.  So is the wallpaper, though the original modern paintings tend to help make things interesting.  Where it loses points is in the furnishings: the mixture of wall lamps, hanging fixtures, and pot lights doesn't work well, the serving bar itself is an ugly cheap laminate, and the touches of plastic greenery dribbled around the place fails misserably.

Iced water is provided, which is decent (plastic cups are a minus), but inferior to the mineral water other places serve. We tried their richly brewed Ethiopian to rave reviews, with the party split on whether the thick ceramic mug was a plus (hefty and warming) or minus (hard to drink from). Truly fantastic coffee, but the lattes were rather disappointing: Beautifully steamed milk in every cup, but a rather bland espresso shot left the latte rather lacking in the nuanced flavour one finds in a 5 star establishment.  The medium latte (12oz, with 2 shots of espresso -- the steongest ratio they offer) should have been far better.

The food looked worth having, but we'd just eaten. Homemade pastries and fresh sandwiches looked tempting, and we certainly will come hungrier next time.

I'm aware, like many reviewers on this site, that not every place is aiming for me as the target customer; but even still, there's no way this is a five star coffee shop. Yes, the coffee is good and if I happen to be lost in highland park someday on foot, I'm sure I'd stop in to get it again.  But the place itself was a turn off, despite the interesting people that it attracts.  Glossy refinished exposed wood beams, fake grape vines over the windows, and odd light fixtures create a tacky atmosphere I can't overlook or sit in.  I think this is a great coffee shop if you happen to own a house in highland park, but for me it's going to be voluto or espresso a mano from now on - it's just not worth the drive.",1,83_p9vIqOq1TUIf3_GD7bA,0,3,2011-01-31,review,3

Tazza D'Oro is one of them. I wont say THE best simply because coffee is such an objective taste but you cannot deny the expertise and care Tazza D'Oro subscribes to. It brings them millions of miles above Starbucks and (gasp) Crazy Mocha.

I found out about Tazza D'Oro while browsing the blog of an award winning, internationally recognized barista. He conveniently mapped out his favorite coffee houses around the US via Google Maps. I clicked on PA and zoomed it, not even expecting to see a marker. Surprisingly there was -- only one -- and it was for Tazza D'Oro.

Their baristas know how to make the perfect espresso. Once you've done that all of your other drinks fall right into place. They also do french pressed coffee which is a rare treat usually enjoyed at home and, at least in my case, not done nearly as well as it should be. Their pastries and baked goods come straight from one of the 'burgh's best bakeries -- Enrico's in the Strip District; what more could you ask for?

I have a longer article on Tazza D'Oro as well as another great coffee shop, Espresso a Mano on my website. http://eatinginpittsburgh.com/2011/02/11/coffee-pittsburgh-part-2/",1,83_p9vIqOq1TUIf3_GD7bA,0,5,2011-02-16,review,5

Make no mistakes, I will finish any coffee drink from Tazza D'oro and at record speed. It is delicious to the very last drop and the best part is, they don't think that third degree burns go hand in hand with their coffee -- it's ready for drinking the moment you receive your order. Let's not forget about the food, which is also delicious. it's clear I have nothing bad to say about this establishment.

Enrico's Tazza D'oro Cafe is definitely very good--I love the location in Highland Park, and the early morning crowd seemed pretty nice and very eclectic.  We even ran in to a friend while we were there and had a nice chat.  

My girlfriend and I ordered lattes which were excellent--the space was overall very nice inside and while the selection of pastries was a bit thin I would say the ones they had looked good.  I do wish they had more outdoor seating, though.  It's tough to make the ""I'm a fan"" list for coffee houses.  I'll try it again and may change my review in the future.

I am a sucker for a good veggie sandwich, especially in combination with caffeine. Even though Enrico's is an easy walk from my home, I find myself either walking further or driving elsewhere for the caffeinated lunch experience. I guess they are trying to keep focus on the brews, but I don't think it's that hard to do both; I mean the staff seems highly competent, they have a kitchen and sandwiches are pretty simple recipes to follow and learn.

But the barista responded: ""No, you can't."" He said they only make their cappuccino plain, and if I liked sweet, he could make me something special, but I would have to trust his taste. Here's the thing...I don't like sweet! I don't have much of a sweet tooth. I just wanted a tiny bit of sweet, so I didn't think trusting his mystery concoction was a good idea. I just got it plain.

It it sometimes busy and hard to find a table (which is not surprising since it's a great spot), but I like the neighborhood feel and the staff has always been very friendly.

I usually get iced Americanos in the summer and regular coffee or lattes in the cooler weather. All of the drinks I have ever had here have been tasty. I have also had some of the pastries (and maybe a bagel at some point?) and everything has been fresh.

I'm a big lover of coffee shops and this place fits all of my requirements. While I don't live in Highland Park, it's definitely worth an occasional trip.",0,83_p9vIqOq1TUIf3_GD7bA,0,4,2014-07-31,review,0

The only other Pittsburgh place where I've found coffee this delicious was at Commonplace Coffee in Squirrel Hill. I went to college near Chicago and come from California.

6dRrPsHJvcxMg3meqg434A,DQsemOSYu_lr861d_7s_bw,"On three separate visits, I've enjoyed three great cups of coffee. No complaints there. Unfortunately, that consistency hasn't been there for everyone. On a visit with my wife, her latte came out far too milky. Probably just a mistake, so we reasoned that this place deserved a second chance. The next time around, we order a pair of cappuccinos, one with vanilla --

Now, before I go any further, I recognize that cappuccinos are typically made without sugar or added flavoring. I have also been to a ton of neighborhood coffee shops, have heard the question ""wet or dry"" a thousand times. Sometimes a ""wet cap"" is really what you're hoping for in a latte. And even when it's not, like most people, I don't snark or complain when someone gives me a cup that isn't quite what I was hoping for. I usually end up liking it anyways. My taste buds aren't that delicate.

Perhaps you can see where I'm going with this story. Vanilla cappuccino. I get it, it's not something that's done. But when someone asks you for something you don't sell, just explain the situation politely. If you feel the need to snark, share knowing glances, or anything along those lines, just stifle it. Trust me, I've seen many professionals perform better with requests far more ridiculous. There's really never any need for snobbery. So I've got to dock Tazza d'Oro a bit.

I ordered the hot chocolate, which was every bit as rich and creamy as a hot chocolate should be. 

On to the food - don't come here if you expect a wide selection of bites to pair with your drink. They only had a few options, but from what I could tell, each one was crafted with love, skill, and just the right amount of sugar. I had a fruit tart (berries and strawberries), which was a delightful combination of tangy and sweet. My friend had a very satisfying chocolate croissant - but to be fair, it's difficult to make a chocolate croissant anything but. I was so impressed that I took home an apple puff pastry and vowed to return posthaste. 

This is precisely the sort of place in which Elizabeth Bennet would while away a dreary day, were coffee shops accessible in rural, Georgian England.

Otherwise you can come in do get some work done, discuss your newest project with your coworkers or just fill out job applications and yelp reviews like I do. 

The Service is friendly and pleasant and the coffee is good. Personally, I have been opting for the Tea which is served in a larger pot if you are dining in.

0xIQG-NrqMx5id6yJpQp8Q,oNFCohmMK8ZAKtbypOqagQ,"The main reasons to go to Buffalo Blues would be for their All You Can Eat Ribs night every Tuesday for $21 and their All You Can Eat Wings night every Wednesday for $9.  Make sure you go with a bunch of guys, because it isn't all you care to eat, it is a challenge.  You have to eat all you can eat and your ego is on the line if you don't.  I once went to Ribs night and one buddy of mine ordered a Buffalo Chicken salad when everyone else ordered ribs.  Yea, he regretted his terrible decision.

Anyways.  The food itself.  The ribs are basic baby back ribs that come in a choice of mild, medium, and hot bbq sauce.  I tend to just go medium, b/c I find a hot bbq sauce covers up the taste of the meat itself, and when I eat ribs I care more about the taste and texture of the actual meat with the sauce being a supporting player.  The ribs are ok for mass produced ribs, nothing spectacular.  The most I've done is only two racks of ribs, but that was only because I didn't want to keep everyone else waiting up for me.  Ribs come in a rack in first round, and then re-orders come by the half rack.

Personally I prefer wing night, as they have fantastic wings.  Wings come in a dozen in the first round, followed by half dozen reorders until you're done.  They have 12 different flavors, but my favorite ones are Buffalo Blue, Old Yeller, and Red Hot Parm.  Buffalo Blue is a tasty bbq sauce that isn't overly sweet like some of their other bbq sauces, Old Yeller is a Carolina Mustard based sauce, and Red Hot Parm is a traditional Buffalo sauce (Frank's Red Hot + Butter) then topped with Parmesan Cheese.  Their Cool Ranch, Garlic Parm, and Spicy Garlic can be a bit greasy, so if you do order one of those make sure its in a batch of 6 and you share with your friends, I kind of like their Spicy Garlic, but no one else ever wants to split an order with me, oh well.  Their Gold Rush and Death Row are their two other non-spicy bbq sauces, but I prefer Buffalo Blue to both of them.

For their spicy flavors, there's Red Hot, which is just a traditional Buffalo, there's Howlin' Wolf, which is a spicy sour sauce with pepper seeds on it, and there's Hotter than Hell, which is a spicy bbq sauce.  Personally I find Howlin' Wolf tasty in small quantities, but sometimes the sourness gets to me.  I tend to find spicy bbq sauces a bit funky, so I'm not big on Hotter than Hell.

If I have a big appetite I eat from 24-30 wings.  If its just a regular day I'll eat around 18-22ish wings.

Note: These wings are huge.  They aren't your typical Wingzone or Quaker Steak and Lube sized wings.  These are real wings from real chickens, not some little baby chicks just hatched from their eggs.

The rest of the menu is just typical American restaurant food with various sandwiches, a burger option, salad options, etc.

The bar is nice in the summer when they open the garage doors.  It's a nice bar to get a beer with friends where you can grab a table to eat then hang out at the bar to watch the game.  But, while they have a good number of HD TVs, only two are broadcast in HD so don't think you'll be getting a great picture.",0,Ts4xsKPU7FNPPZRj-nRjIg,0,4,2009-04-08,review,1

It's one of the few places that doesn't reek of cigarettes, it's never crowded and the open garage doors are great for fresh air.

I tried their buffalo (boneless) wings last night in the jack daniel's sauce  - way better than Sharp Edge's. The sauce was pretty mild but still quite tasty and if you're not a super wings eater, you can get a fries/wings combo for super cheap. To wash it down I had Loose Cannon beer, how can you pass up a beer with a pirate tap handle!

Our waitress was a little slow, she said it was her first night. Who makes a new girl work on a Friday night! She seemed to have gotten more attentive and fast towards the end, or maybe it's because I wasn't hungry anymore so I didn't care.

I would probably only go again on an all-you-can-eat wings night.  For $10 I would certainly get my money's worth, and the quality of the food was OK.

Predicting a healthy selection of nachos and other cheese drenched options at the steeler game, I had a salad.  I expected it to be sad and pathetic, as salads at wing joints often are, but it was really good!

kWkgwRxqWD-h260dMTkHUA,cNP5oVchRPTcHHDKsQVJNg,"I ate at this restaurant last night with three dining companions.  We decided to sit in the bar area at a high table which had views of the ample number of TV's.  The beer list that they had was nice with about 20 different beers on tap and a nice selection of bottles.  I ended up having the Philly Shackamaximum with my waitress telling me that she preferred the Long Trails Porter.  It was served in a chilled glass and tasted pretty good to me.

For dinner we attempted to start off by ordering the Blues BBQ Pork Nachos.  We were told that they did not have any pork and so we were not able to order it.  At this point we were also told that they did not have any veggie burgers as well.  So we started out with the Chicken Chili Nachos.  They were pretty good and were covered with real cheese as opposed to nacho cheese which was to my liking.  For dinner I decided on having the Lovely Lisa's Salad since I love both blue cheese and granny smith apples.  Upon receiving the salad I dug in.  The chicken was cooked nicely, moist and tender, and there was a nice coating of blue cheese on the salad.  However there was a problem since there were no granny smith apples on the salad.  Whenever the waitress came back to check on us I asked about the missing apples.  She went to the kitchen and came back and told us that they were out of them and promptly left.  I am not normally one to complain but I feel like something could have been substituted in for the apples, or that I should have been told before ordering or they could have discounted the salad but none of that occurred.  It is sad that it happened too because the rest of my salad was pretty good but that left the proverbial bitter taste in my mouth.

The bottom line is that I have been here before and the food is generally good.   However, leaving a major part off an item and being told that the kitchen is out without any rectification will make me think twice before returning here again.  It is a shame because Buffalo Blues does have potential.",0,Ts4xsKPU7FNPPZRj-nRjIg,0,2,2012-01-30,review,1
yfRrC6MhxpIJ4-xMcrmk5Q,bSI6Yn4HtrSW5U7fOQjq0w,"My coworkers and I had lunch here on a Friday afternoon, and it was a pretty ""meh"" experience for me.  We were seated all the way in the back of the restaurant/bar, in a room that I didn't even know existed, so apparently Buffalo Blues is bigger than I thought.  It's nice that they have some tables away from the main bar area.

I went for the Hot Veggie Sandwich with sweet potato fries, in some kind of attempt to be healthy.  The sweet potato fries weren't too bad, with a good flaky crisp.  The sandwich left something to be desired.  It wasn't hot, first of all - I'd say the (slightly crumbly) bread had been toasted with the cheese, but all the veggie ingredients were cold, leaving an overall lukewarm effect on the sandwich.  The hummus spread didn't taste much like hummus, and was thick and pastey instead of smooth and creamy.  There wasn't a lot of exciting flavor,  It was just belly-filler, really.  I guess that's what I get for trying to order healthy here.  

I just wasn't much interested in it, and I don't think it was worth anywhere near $8.  I better have a darn good sandwich if I'm paying $8.  Also, it was relatively small in size - I don't have a huge appetite, so that wasn't a problem.  But I guess I think an $8 sandwich should either be awesomely delicious, or big enough that I can take half home.  Buffalo Blues was neither.

sS2sSWqZMnQMRoWx-Mdzgg,rmxydx4rmbOPwrM5iOlqpQ,"The best thing about Buffalo Blues revolves around Sundays during football season. For me, personally, it's one of the best places to catch an NFL game...especially if you're not a Steelers fan. On any given Sunday, you'll find fans of just about every team in the NFL taking in a game, so the atmosphere is a positive one. Seating is the only issue. Get there early or you might end up standing to see your particular game, as seating can be a premium by the time the games begin. Luckily, the TV's (there are lots of them) are all labeled with the day's matchups, so finding the game you're looking for isn't a problem.

The draft beer selection usually has something for everyone, from local craft brews by East End Brewing, to seasonals and your simpler standards (hello, PBR), so if you're a beer person, you won't be disappointed.

As far as service goes, it's hit-or-miss. I've had mostly great service at the bar, but I've also had average to below average service at tables. During bigger sporting events - primarily Steelers games - the service can be even more iffy due to the sheer volume of people in the bar area.

Overall, I have to rate the food as average. I LOVE their boneless wings, and their wing sauces are all very excellent. Their pulled pork is really tender and delicious, as well, but most of their sandwiches and burgers are simply average. The fries can be either really good, or too soggy and greasy. I think the inconsistency in the quality of the cooking is the main issue. The menu reads really well, which raises your expectations, but sometimes the execution will leave you a little disappointed. It's never horrible, but you'll rarely be blown away by your meal.

In the end, I'm giving Buffalo Blues a higher rating based on the experience during sporting events, which, let's face it, is the real draw of a ""sports bar."" As far as sports bars go, it's my favorite place to catch a game. They always get a good crowd for games (whether Sundays during the NFL season, Saturdays during big college games, or for Pens games), and if you stick to the wings and beer, odds are your experience will be great. There's a good chance that you can go in and find fans of your team if you're an out-of-towner looking for a game, and the crowd is much more accepting, friendly, and relaxed than the crowds I've experience in other sports bars in town. Most of my average experiences revolved around non-game times when you try to get a more traditional meal and realize that there are just better options in Shadyside for lunch and dinner.",1,Ts4xsKPU7FNPPZRj-nRjIg,1,3,2012-02-28,review,1

I was mainly interested in seeing Madonna. I do have to say that we had a server who gave us the utmost attention. We had been seated at some tables near the bar mid restaurant that were wobbling and driving me crazy. At the request of the party she moved us up front and center to a much better and stable seat. Much better view to see the Material girl! So our server gets 5 STARS! Not only for that reason, she kept the glasses full and kept checking in with us, and took it all in stride as we ordered at different times and all had separate checks. Very classy, wish I could remember her name. Young girl with dirty blond hair. 

The food was pretty blah in my opinion. Bar food none too exceptional. We had nachos that were on slightly stale chips. Good size. Everyone had a burger or sandwich. As I glanced over to my friends Pulled pork it looked dry and sad left sitting on the plate. She said it was ""EH"". I ordered a Gobbler Club sandwich. It was humongous but not that tasty, pretty dry. How can you go wrong with a club but the thick cuts of turkey did not sit well with me and I didn't like it at all. Bad texture. The commercials and time with fun friends saved the experience but I wouldn't go back to eat. Just drinks and sports. I like the location. Easy to park. Close to shadyside.

3h4VbpuqlZeVCSuqq9bdeQ,RibII_r2z-lPukxDwaNGeg,"So, I went to Buffalo Blues tonight for the second time (not the second time tonight, the second time in my life) for dinner and some drinks, and to sum up my experience in a few words, both times it was about what I expected.  Just a fine sports bar - no more, no less.

I'll start with the drinks.  They have a good draft selection, and supposedly they've got a nice bottle list too, though I didn't have a look at it, so I can't judge; and the Happy Hour special compliments it well ($1 off all drinks 5PM-7PM).   Plus they have East End drafts at $3/glass all the time, though they were out of Big Hop (the only East End choice they have) when I was there (I don't know if this is a regular occurrence, but if it is, they better do something about it).  The bartenders were friendly and quick to serve, qualities that carried over to the food service as well.

The menu has a pretty good selection of pub-y and Southwestern-themed foods from which I picked the black bean and corn quesadilla.  Although at the end I was running low on guacamole (which is $1 extra for a small cup) and sour cream, this is a small quibble.  The meal overall  was good, and since I got it with the happy hour special, I can't complain.  One thing I will mention is that there aren't too many vegetarian choices on the menu (I'm not vegetarian, but I try not to eat too much meat, so I notice these things), so if you're a vegetarian, I would try to look up the menu beforehand just to be sure there's something for you.

I know I haven't said much negative about Buffalo Blues in this review, yet I'm still giving it only three stars.  This is the kind of place that makes me appreciate the ""word versions"" of the ratings that Yelp gives us.  ""A-OK,"" which, if you didn't know, is how Yelp describes three-star reviews, is exactly how I would describe Buffalo Blues.  The comparison I keep going to in my head is Die Hard 2.  It's not nearly as good as its predecessor, but it's still something I'm fine with popping in every once in a while when there's nothing better to watch.

To sum it up - I'm not a big sports guy.  Buffalo Blues, though it is a sports bar, is not the place that would sway me to go to watch a game there with my friends (I'll still say that some kind of playoff game of the Steelers-Ravens I watched at Big Jim's was one of the best sports-watching experiences of my life).  And, judging it as a sports bar, it didn't do anything to justify my giving it anything but ""just fine.""

UFem4aIQoL9MtejCZQ6YDg,hnnT9vXu-m2PZeOKpqX-6Q,"When Hotlick's died, Buffalo blues was born. It really is a Pittsburgh staple but come on....

Food is really, really average. I love the ribs and wings, but it's about the same as any other rib place in the city, only they charge an arm and a leg for it. This place is for the people that feel that they are at a real rib place, but don't want to cross Centre or Penn Ave. to get real ribs. It, technically is in Shadyside so your Mercedes will be safe! 

The ambiance: The restaurant is always crowded. Not just crowded, but packed with teens underage drinking, families with too many kids that overflow to your ""space"" and collage kids who also spill over from the bar. IT'S LOUD AS HELL!!! Forget about a nice quiet dinner. There seems to be no consideration for customers at all. Last time I was there, there was a St. Patrick's Day party (it was NOT St. Patrick's Day) that took over the whole place. Though the staff tried (nah, they didn't really try) to keep them in the so called ""party room"" I was bumped into several times, spilled my beer, and couldn't hear my wife speak. But as long as they got their money; they could give a crap. Oh and there are like 100 TVs to interrupt any conversation at your table.

Want to sit in the bar area? Good luck. You will see a mix of drunk people, women who look like high-end prostitutes and college kids who are only missing a beer bong. Also IT'S LOUD AS HELL!!!!!!!!

The ""wonderful"" Staff: It seems like it's everyone's first day. To put it lightly; the staff suck! To be sure, you will be waiting for your your drinks, food and bill for a very, very long time. Expect to be there for about 2-3 hours. The wait staff are forgetful, inattentive and very sloppy at their job. It pains me to leave any tip for them. Most of the staff are hot, stacked, absolutely stupid and should be working at Hooters not a place where your bill will be upwards of $50 for two people. Be prepared to be met with this saying, ""Oh, like ohmygod, I am so sorry i forgot that, he he!"" (oh she's twisting her finger in her hair while she's talking). You will get bad service...period (in fact, I can't remember the last time a wait person actually wrote down my order, and they're idiots so no worries).

The food: Kinda good. Menu is huge, you'll find something you like. But I go there about 2-3 times a year for the food. It is way too expensive. Do not take a date there. Your average bill for a meal with actual proteins will run you in the high 40s without booze. There are so many bar-food places that don't claim to be high class that are just as good as this place. I grew up with the rib sauce and love it, but for your average consumer, skip it!

This place is a wannabe sports bar that tries too hard to be high end. Just watch out for the vomiting college kids with trust funds...they're everywhere!!!!!",0,Ts4xsKPU7FNPPZRj-nRjIg,1,2,2012-05-08,review,1

My husband and I went to Buffalo Blues last night. We stood at the empty hostess stand for a while. When no one came to seat us, and we couldn't find anyone to seat us, we seated ourselves figuring that's what we were supposed to do.

The bar was full, but not packed. There were only two other tables with guests, one of which had empty plates on the table during this entire experience. After what seemed like forever, my husband got up to find a server. He literally walked around the restaurant to find someone, but couldn't. He then tried to ask the bartender, but she was just as elusive. When he finally found a server,  she acted totally shocked that we were there. Maybe if someone had been doing their job, they wouldn't be surprised to find hungry people in a restaurant.

She came to our table, got our drinks (a soda and a water) and asked us if we were ready to order. When we said no she said she would be back. We could see her chit chatting with another server, but again, couldn't get her attention to come back to take our order. After another ten minutes of waiting for her to return, we put a few dollars on the table for my soda and we left. We ordered a pizza at a local shop and picked it up on our way home.

Twenty-five minutes passed and we only get drinks? Such a waste of time. It took us 20 minutes just to make the drive there, 25 of waiting, and another 20 to get home.

-6rEfobYjMxpUWLNxszaxQ,Hecjsz-Ewe9WzaFCDov79g,"I hate this place. I have been here many times and I am just finally getting around to writing a review.  Let me state that my wife made me go here tonight because my friends wanted to and she said I need to indulge their interests. Even if they suck. 

Buffalo Blues is like a Hooters, except the girls where more clothes and are not as good looking. The service is horrendous and the food may be better at Hooters.  The beer selection is decent at Buffalo Blues but it is expensive and they often run out of things that are still on the board.

My friends like going for all you can eat wing night but frankly I don't get it. You get 10 wings up front they will give more wings 5 at a time. The problem is that you get those wings in 30 minute intervals.  So the max you could eat is 55 wings. Did I mention that  the wings are really tiny and the sauce is tossed on like a Jackson Pollack painting.  They also charge extra for blue cheese or ranch.  The wings do not come with celery. This is a crime against humanity and the city of Buffalo.  

I chose to detour from wings tonight and ordered a chicken sandwich. Apparently this was a bad choice.  It took a full hour to get my food. It was so long that the rest of the table ate their wings and ordered more and the waitress didn't think this was a problem. When my meal did arrive everything was cold. The sandwich was ok, but the fries were just tiny pieces that were limp and flavorless.

I paid $16 for a beer and a sandwich that my friends had to wait for me to eat to leave.  I would say I won't go back, but apparently I like my friends more than I like good food and service.",0,Ts4xsKPU7FNPPZRj-nRjIg,0,1,2013-10-30,review,1

5gi8yR20fvnim2dg3n-MpQ,KydWlGaGat9R15Po2T7Ocg,"I have a love-hate relationship with this place...  

I love it because it's extremely close to me (so, it's convenient when I'm craving a beer) and the atmosphere on Sundays is outstanding.  I'm a giant Steeler fan, but you'll probably find fans from all 32 teams in Buffalo blues, which gives it a fun and exciting feel during NFL Sundays.  

However, I hate it because I believe the alcohol and food is overpriced.  The food wouldn't rub me the wrong way so much if I thought it was worth the price, but I don't.  Not even a little bit.  The only thing I have found to be delicious there were the wings; however, you can go to almost any other bar to get delicious and cheaper wings.  So, it's not really much of a win at all.  Also, I want to have a handful of beers during the games, but I don't want to empty my pockets doing it.  So, all in all, I recommend going once and awhile (mainly on Sundays) for a beer or two, but other than that it's not worth much of a visit.",0,Ts4xsKPU7FNPPZRj-nRjIg,0,2,2014-01-13,review,0
vcZFBFe-nF60JmwIbJ1f2Q,cTZcCCmBaZaQAcDgqWLzbg,"I have mixed feelings about this place.  I'll say up front: I only ever go there on Sundays for football, and I would never go there for any other reason.  It is the only bar I know of in the city where you can reliably find every NFL game televised and enjoy your Sunday if you're not a Steelers fan.  Pretty much every team is represented by the crowd on Sundays, with a disproportional number of Bills and Redskins fans.  The crowd is generally friendly, with many of the same faces from week to week.

They tend to have a wide selection of beers that rotates pretty regularly, but wide selection doesn't always mean good selection.  That said, sometimes they get some really great beers that you wouldn't expect to find at a sports bar.  Whatever you do, don't order a bloody Mary, they're atrociously bad.  The staff is almost universally friendly, with the exception of one barback who seems to always be in a bad mood and rude to customers (he often takes over as bartender later in the day on Sundays).  That said, the wait staff don't seem to know much about the food or beers that are offered, often mis-characterizing new beers that are on tap or giving wrong information about things on the menu.

The food is mediocre and over-priced.  When two of us go for one game on a Sunday, drink 3-4 beers each and each order an entrée, we generally end up with a tab in the $80-90 range, depending on what we're drinking that day.  In a city that is almost universally accommodating to vegetarians, this place is most decidedly not.  They have a veggie burger which is actually pretty good, but it's the only decent thing on the menu for a vegetarian to eat (there is also a grilled cheese sandwich and a veggie sandwich, both of which are bland to the point of tasteless.  It's like eating plain bread).  They have 4 entrée salads, and every one of them has meat as a defining ingredient.  They don't even have beans so you could have decent veggie nachos.  I know, it's a sports bar, but I don't want to eat the same veggie burger every Sunday for 17 weeks.  It gets old.  Fast.

Upshot?  In the absence of a new sports bar opening up, we'll be back next season, but not before then.",0,Ts4xsKPU7FNPPZRj-nRjIg,0,3,2014-01-13,review,0

I do enjoy a good sports bar, but I think the thing I hated most about this place was the other people that frequent there. It's the quintessential Shadyside bar, equipped with doughebag bros that went to the same fraternity in college and the Jersey Shore bimbos who pine for them.

We were sitting at the booths right next to the bar but instead of the bartender just telling us so we could make another decision and get our drinks as soon as possible, she waited for the waitress to come back to tell her. Then, the waitress came back and did not apologize at all but simply said that he had to pick a different beer because they were out of that one.

We went on a regular oll Sunday night and even though the wings were tasty, my frugal self would've rather had AYCE.

 The boozy buffalo is a good drink. It consist of smirnoff orange, tanquery, jose cuervo, captain, triple sec, OJ, fresh squeezed lemon and a splash of Coke. I seriously felt fabulous after one. It's served in a mason jar. ($12)

Lauren was a nice server even though the table in front of us put her through some bs-- they ate all of their food then complained to the server and asked for the manager complaining that what they got it wasn't what they ordered... no idea why they waited until every scrap of food was gone to complain but you know, you'll have that. kudos to Lauren for keeping a smile on her face.",0,Ts4xsKPU7FNPPZRj-nRjIg,0,3,2014-05-29,review,1

I have had quite a few things in the menu but two things that I love more than others are the cobb salad and the Oscar's Garbage burger. 
     The cobb salad is just a cob salad, but some how they make it better than most. I don't know if it's the sprout or the dressing, but it is one of the best cobb salads I have ever had. 
     And the garabge burger....Mmmmmmm. This burger caught my attenetion at first because it has an egg on it. I lovelovelove a burger with an egg on it.  I don't know what genuis started the egg on a burger trend, but kudos to you!
But that's not all. Imagine a Primanti's sandwich but with a big, fat burger. It has fries, cole slaw, an egg and American cheese. My BF often comments it's strange there's no bacon, but honestly, that'd be over kill. 

They also have a really good veggie sandwich with Hummus (I don't remember the name), a great buffalo chicken sandwich and fantastic appitizers. 

Also, it's worth mentioning they hace really good hand cut fries- not those mushy frozen crap sticks- and GREAT fresh homemade potato chips. 

Now, as far as the ribs and wings go, I'm not a big ribs/wings person. I can appreciate that they're good, but I wouldn't order it much.

We came close to leaving as my beer was off the draft list, but we decided to stay and were disappointed that my daughter's choice was already gone although still ilsted.  The food was awful, the service worse.  Maybe a busser should clean the table after removing the dirty dishes--our table was a sticky  mess.  The service:  one beer to the table at a time.  Next round I saw two beers go to a three-top, removed and sent to the bar, poured out and the glasses refilled and brought to us.  Someone else's food was brought to our table, our fries came out --lukewarm---but our wing order never went in.  So we got our garlic parm wings which tasted like old overcooked chicken and was way too crispy and greasy for my taste.  We ate two each, then told the server we didn't want them.  She offered to take them off, but we told her that wasn't necessary, so they took off 1/2 the price as a Customer service gesture.

The sauce and meat in my meals isn't as flavorful as other Chinese take-outs have been, but it's still tasty. And my experience with the staff has been fine. Also FYI, it's cash only, and there's an ATM right outside by the door. I've never eaten in (there's a few tables) or in the buffet that's attached next door, so I can't speak on that.

pRyrLnk2ayyAdeZRsh5kVQ,dUSee9yB_JaU2_dloh1nMA,"I came in with a flat.  They said they couldn't repair the tire because there was cracking on the edges.  True there were cracks, but they were hairline cracks and superficial.  The diagnosis was done just from examining the exterior, which I discovered, is not sufficient to adequately judge if the cracking is bad enough--you have to actually take the tire off.

Coincidentally, all four tires had the light cracking and therefore all four tires would probably need replacing.  Hmmm....  How convenient for Monro?

Well, even if I give them the benefit of the doubt on the tire cracking, the pricing on the tires was ridiculous.  My tires, which were under warranty, would have cost over $500 to get replaced with crap tires (that's with the warranty credit applied).  Oh but wait, they could make me a deal with some in-house tires that were even crappier for $480.  How did I know they were crappy?  I looked them up online.  Guess what else I found.  Both sets of tires were significantly cheaper according to the Manufacturer's website even when including installation, balancing, and disposal!  

So no, no thank you.  I don't want to pay $500 to get cheap tires on my car.

Fortunately, my tire would hold air for a few hours so I drove to another place.  They fixed the flat no problem for $20.  Guess that cracking wasn't so bad after all.",1,t15LDNaHFpu-bAEJSdoV-g,1,1,2012-06-27,review,1

In March I blew a tire on a pothole (naturally) and they replaced the two front tires for me. The second tire was fine but you have to replace both, I kept it so that I would have a spare if another one blew out. Put the tires in my basement, no problem. Saved for a rainy day. 

This week I ran over a nail and the tire wasn't fixable so I had to get it replaced. Luckily I've got a spare!

I drop the car off at Pep Boys and tell them the extra tire is in the back. They call me up and tell me the tire is the wrong size. What? Monro gave me the wrong tires back when they replaced them in March. So I had to buy a new tire when I had a perfectly good one that is now god knows where. The tire was the wrong size and definitely didn't come from my car as it wouldn't have fit on the rim. 

After paying for the tire at Pep Boys I went over to Monro to see what they would do about it.

I bought a shitty used car and it kept DYING when I would drive uphill, and I was new in town so I asked for some shop recommendations from people online and a bunch of people pointed me to Walters. He helped me isolate the problem to my EGR valve, and while it wasn't a cheap fix, I can't imagine I could've gotten the work done any cheaper. I've also had several other problems, and he's always trying to save me money and do things as inexpensively as possible.

I wouldn't say my shitmobile runs like a dream or anything, but it's definitely in much better shape than when I started.

And I usually don't have to wait too long for repairs. Typically I can drop it off in the morning (after making an appointment a few days in advance) and pick it up later that day. Though, they do seem pretty busy so I try not to expect them to get it done too quickly.

And I have to say, I really don't care if my mechanic is a friendly, personable guy because I'm just paying him to fix my car and as long as he does that right I'm happy.

All of a sudden, the tire warning signal lights up even though I don't remember running over anything. I get out of the car to carefully inspect my tires and they feel/look completely OK. But after owning a BMW for 3 years and having constant wheel alignment/tire issues (ie. when a tire warning signal lights up, it usually means my tire's about to blow out!!), I freaked out and frantically drove my Infiniti to the first 3 auto shops on Baum Blvd. I waited at the first stop for 5-10 minutes and the guy did not get off the phone. I got back into the car and drove it over to Pep Boy's where a mechanic was outside smoking. He says I need to go through their service desk (inside their huge store) and deal with them first. I'm thinking, ""ugh. no time. I have class in 40 minutes and I'm already late to my meeting."" I drive past the 3rd shop and I don't even see anyone sitting at the reception desk and figure it's going to take forever to get what I'm asking for.

Then, I remembered the really positive experience I had with Walter's. I decided to drive to the end of Baum Blvd. to find his place and boy, am I glad I did. As soon as I got there, the service coordinator told me to pull my car around front so that their mechanic could take a look at my tires. He stopped what he was doing to do this and told me I could just stay in my car. Then, he reassured me that my tires were OK and he proceeded to inflate them, explaining to me why the signals might have come on.

The ""office"" must be very messy and grease and dirt must be everywhere.  

In my opinion, if an auto shop has the time and money to keep a squeaky clean appearance, they're wasting some of your money you pay for service.  Walter's Automotive fits the bill with their ""office"" being a small cluttered desk in the service bay.  Their ""lobby"" is the doorway that you stand in just outside the ""office.""

Really, they just don't follow the corporate America scheduling system that generally fails anyway. I was referred to them by a classmate of mine that has lived here 4 years. With the sounds my car was making, I anticipated $1000's of damage. They couldn't figure it out the first time I was there but looked it over and made sure that the noise wasn't posing any danger given a lengthy trip up to Wisconsin being made. He didn't charge me a thing after checking it out top to bottom. After that trip (and having it checked out in Wisconsin also to no avail), the sounds got worse. I took it back in, they made a quick fix solving one issue. I asked how much the damage was for today and he replied that it  'took him two minutes' to fix one noise but had to order another part for it to fix everything else. Didn't charge me a thing.
So now, after now three visits to them, I am completely sold. Tim is great. Arlene is great. The mechanics know what they're doing. Tim has each time, driven around in my car with me to make sure that I am satisfied with what's done. Never once has this been done at any other mechanic I've been to - I've just assumed that it's all better. My final bill was considerably less than others when compared online and in phone call inquiries. I will always go back to them as long as I live in Pittsburgh. And I recommend you do the same.

I arrived on time, and he was ready for me -- no waiting. I told him I only have one car, and would have to wait in the area, so he said he would get to work on it ASAP. Sure enough, about 1.5 hours later it was done.

Even better, he told me nothing was wrong with it, so it would only cost me the price of the inspection. My car is only 6 years old, yet every other year wherever I took it there was a whole list of things which needed to be done, which ended up costing anywhere from $400-$600.

First time I brought my car in it was making noises near the wheels.  I figure it had something to do with the brakes.  It was an older car and things were rusted and old so I figure it was time to replace it.  They looked over the car, test drove it, saw something was unaligned and fixed it easily.  Didn't charge me anything because it was an easy and quick fix.

The second time, I dropped my car off because it was making a clunking sound whenever I would accelerate/brake.  It's a newer car and I just bought it two months ago.  So I was very annoyed that I had to bring it in already.  I dropped it off at 10am and got a call at 2pm saying they test drove it, looked it over, saw suspension was fine, nothing wrong except for some loose stuff around the axle.  They tightened everything back up and the problem was gone.  When I asked how much do I owe them, he said nothing since they didn't fix anything just tightened it all up.

This is why the reviews keep saying they're honest.  They could easily charge me for the easy fixes and labor.  They could say I had more serious problems and I wouldn't know any better.  But luckily they didn't.  I was tight on money this month and was dreading to hear the bill.

I am happy driving my car again knowing the problem was small and there's no real issue with the car.

I wanna show you something.""  They said all this other stuff was wrong with my car and quoted me an estimate of $1705 for the repairs.  I got up this morning and googled ""honest auto mechanic Pittsburgh"" Walter's place was the first place that came up. Tons of 5 star reviews.  Gave them a call.  They had me come on over and got my front and back brakes done for me.  (The other place said the brakes and the rotors were bad 3 months ago.) He mentioned the motor mount.  The other place told me all 4 were bad.  2 were bad.  So I ended up having Walter take care of that too because if I find someone who is honest, fast & efficient then I'm sticking with them.

For instance none of the programmers on staff have any training in performing arts, they are all visual arts people playing at another field.  As a result they don't even know what they are really producing and any experienced person in the field can tell.

I called the location and the said they were open to five. I will admit I almost did not go. If they have lines early in the morning all the goodies would have likely been gone a few hours from closing but I decided to give it a whirl nevertheless.

A quaint location, a few two tops here and there, a small area to shop there. Beautiful baskets and other nicknacks. In the back is there bakery shelves which are strangely set up in the back right. The location is not the best to peruse offerings. I am fortunate I did not arrive when it was busy I would have been unable to see much before I was next in line!

I ordered the Chocolate Tulip. It was a hand-made shell filled with mousse & cake, with ganache drizzle, cream and berries. Rich and moist. Smooth and fluffy mousse. Not overly sweet. A nice marriage of creamy, rich, and sweet. Loved this delight. I also had a tasty cupcake. The cake was not as rich as that in the tulip. Yet, the frosting was a divine passion fruit. Yum.

They do have amazing ham and cheese sandwiches, that are kinda pricy, but oh so good. And if you want them, you better get there early on the weekend! They're small, so get 2 for yourself at least :)

We've also tried the Nutella tart, which i've had twice now because it's SO DELICIOUS. The fruit tart is not bad, cinnamon buns are great, jewish pizza is ok (not what I was expecting - it's kinda like a fruitcake - like the dreaded holiday kind - but denser and drier), strata (eggy bread dish) which was pretty good, key lime cake - so so good, and quiche (good). 

Seating is hit or miss, since there's only a few tables (3 of them seat 4 people, 1 seats 2 people). On a quieter morning you should be able to find a seat. They serve coffee as well (nothing to write home about), $2 a cup, but if you like coffee with your dessert like me, it's nice to have.",0,YMEtEsUDQKOYJOcE5Fx3gQ,0,5,2014-09-10,review,0

I fell in love instantly. And came back several times after first discovering this hidden gem. You walk in and the wonderful smells just overwhelm you in just an amazing way. The ambiance is that of an old style kitchen- personally, it reminds me of one of my aunts kitchens, which gives it that homey feel that is so comforting. They have seating- which I never saw in any bakeries prior to this one. They also serve coffee and encourage you to take a seat and enjoy your sweet treat. 

They offer such a unique array of sweets. Definitely not your typical bakery. Pies, tortes, mooses and cookies.. And when they do have cinnamon rolls, grab them! They are a hot commodity! My personal favorite is their key lime pie. Oh my goodness. It's amazing. They have had it every time that I came, thank goodness. Their key lime cake is phenomenal as well. Their fruit tarts are incredible, the chocolate moose is amazing- they have a lot of items with fresh fruit which I love! 

My only critiques- the hours: they are closed on Mondays and Sundays :/, not ideal for someone whose only day off is typically Sunday. And also, they write all the items thy have in the case on a small chalkboard posted on the wall to the right of the case. Every time I go, I find myself asking the employees what everything is, which I find to be a little annoying. Regardless- it's worth it. It's such a hidden gem and going there and experiencing their sweets is a real treat.",1,YMEtEsUDQKOYJOcE5Fx3gQ,0,5,2014-09-15,review,2

She said that they were incredible but that they sold out really quickly after the store opened. We happened to walk past the store at 10:15 AM (the store opened at 10 that day), so we decided to try our luck. We arrived just in time, and we managed to snag the very last cinnamon roll (at least at the moment; maybe they make more later, but I'm not sure). We also got three macarons: one blue velvet, one PB&J, and one salted caramel. All of these items totaled to $9, which I think it a pretty good deal. 

The cinnamon roll was outstanding. It was soft, buttery, and perfectly sweet. All of the macarons were top notch too. They had thin, crispy shells with a chewy inside and subtle but still very recognizable (and tasty) fillings.

Also I had ordered a peanut butter caramel rice crispy treat and she did not cut it into pieces after she offered; and she placed the fruit tart near the flaps to the top so the cream got smushed into it.

That being said one of the guests really enjoyed the chocolate chip cookies - he ate one and then came back for the second; another enjoyed the napoleon; and the peanut butter caramel rice crispy treat and pumpkin roll were good. The desserts were good and had a homemade feel.

I was waiting to be seated for brunch at E2 next door with some friends, and one of them suggested that we swing by the bakery next door.  This reminded me that that bakery was Food Glorious Food, which I'd been meaning to check out for a long while, so I eagerly agreed and we headed next door.

Having read the previous Yelp reviews, I knew that the cinnamon roll was a popular item.  Give that I'm always on the hunt for good cinnamon rolls--of which there seem to be precious few in PGH--I got one of them ($2) as well as a chocolate chip cookie ($2), which the guy working the counter told me was another popular seller.  I had the cinnamon roll later that day, and it was pretty good, although not the best I've had in PGH.  It had a decent amount of both cinnamon and icing, and the dough was soft and pliable.  I tried the cookie the next day, and it was quite delicious--possibly the best one I've had to date in PGH.  It was a decent size and has a decent balance between crispness and softness.  Most importantly, however, it had copious chocolate chips that melted in my mouth, which (for me) is an essential component of a legit chocolate chip cookie.

Based on the goods I sampled, I'd rank Food Glorious Food within the upper quartile of PGH bakeries.  Unfortunately, I'm leaving PGH soon, but if I wasn't, I'd definitely love to stop by again to sample their key lime pie, as I'm a big fan of that dessert.  4.5 stars.",13,YMEtEsUDQKOYJOcE5Fx3gQ,4,4,2016-06-13,review,12

They named this place after this song. Stopped over here after lunch to grab a dessert. Most of the desserts I have seen before but they had a few different ones for me to try.

They are a bakery but they only sell desserts, wedding cakes, and various quiches. I purchased a spinach and mushroom quiche to take home with me for my next day's lunch. It must have been popular-it smelled so good when I got it home. Can't wait to taste it! I'm sure I'm going to love it. They had small whole pies along with what they call a great chocolate chip cookie. I bought that for my daughter and got a nice slice of apple streusel. The crust on that thing was flaky and soft. They do give you generous portions for the price you pay. They do offer a nice assortment of desserts.

I decided to try something a little different while I was there which was called a signature white lily cake. I later learned they use this same batter for wedding cakes. I had it and found that it was not too rich but light enough for me to enjoy after a heavy meal. They have a small sitting area in front if you wish to eat it there. Some of the desserts require refrigeration. Others don't but make sure you wrap them if you intend to eat them later.

Since I had arrived later in the day the breakfast pastries were gone but I'm sure if I return at an earlier time of day they would be worth a try. Street parking is available. This place is off the beaten path but well worth the visit.

Confusion sets in as soon as you near the place, and before you step foot in the door.  Do I park on the street, do I pull in that lot that has all the confusing signs?  Take your pick it doesn't really matter.  Careful crossing the streets to get here.  

Once inside, the confusion continues.  Signs are somewhat lacking and really don't directly tell you where you need to go.  Getting lost is easy in here.  Majority of the time, escalators are down for maitenence, making it that much harder to navigate the building.

My soul purpose to coming here was to get my license picture taken.  At usual locations for the DMV, you walk in, take a number and sit and wait.  Not here.  Without a sign to indicate that you need to stop at the reception desk until you make it to the DMV portion of the floor, you have to turn around and wait in a line.  And when you wait, you get to hear the receptionist make a snarky remark about how you can't read a sign...MAKE IT BIGGER AND PUT IT WHERE A PERSON, not a dog, CAN SEE IT.

Anyway, this place is AAA as the name states, so I would suggest you get a membership before coming as their computers are very, very slow.  My husband went in without a membership and signed up, and because of their computers, we were there close to 3 hours. So be warned.  

The customer service is very nice and they try to do their best to please their customers. If you are getting plates here, make sure you have EVERYTHING, otherwise you will be coming in for nothing. Since the title of my care had my husbands name on it as well, I had to get a power of attorney so I could get the care registered. So that kinda tells you just how much stuff the state requires. 

Overall my wait was not too bad. Just bring a book or download a game on your phone in case you end up waiting to be seen.",0,-raHHPz6kBnQgBH-oCuDFA,0,3,2014-08-05,review,0

Also, my car was totaled a couple of years ago (some jagoff who was texting rear-ended me, ahem, please don't do this), and they were phenomenal. I had a check for the full amount in less than a week.

I see a lot of negative reviews here for services that are title related. I don't know if those people are even AAA employees, they might be DOT for all we know. I've had three title transactions, including one for a car that was from out of state, and they all went smoothly.

It is better to have a AAA membership when you go here because you will get a discount, but it is the only DMV in the area. It is convenient because of that, and they do validate parking.
I recently bought an SUV out of state. The transfer could not have been easier, even with the messed up mileage written down by the idiot I bought it from. Can you believe he actually tried to sell me the truck with a Bill of Sale?? Yeah, um NO! (I'm just justifying calling him an idiot).
You can get pretty much everything done here, even get your license renewed. Do not go here on the weekend. It is a zoo. And don't go here during lunch hours during the week. Around 2 in the afternoon on a weekday has done me well.

I said if they don't come with a flatbed truck, then no use.  He said I would get priority service for the flatbed if air was not sufficient.  Air was not sufficient, the guy called for a flatbed and I waited and wait.   I called AAA again and was told that since I was at home, I should wait longer. So the air in tire was wasted time.  Finally someone came and it was NOT a flatbed truck.  He said that this was better than a flatbed.  It was getting late.  He forgot to release emergency brake and towed it to garage with brake on!

Place was a little bit of a disaster. Its easy to be dissatisfied and rant about a customer services organization. So i take my hits with a grain of salt with these places (and not yelp about it). But this place's incompetency took the cake.

Im military living outside of PA. Made calls to AAA and asked if i could renew my PA license on the spot - was told i could. So i drove 6 hours there on a weekend to renew. Upon arriving i got three different stories from three different AAA people (all adamant on their stance of how to renew). It ended with the last person telling me I couldnt do it (had to wait 10 days for a camera card first before renewing - which I couldnt do). The confusion wouldnt have been that much of a gripe to yelp about - but the 'matter of fact' language used with all the conflicting opinions of a non existent policy was the nail in the yelp coffin for them.

I've been interested in a bunch of the nights they've hosted before, but have never made way way over. I went to celebrate one Miss Aja J's birthday for Hip Hop vs House night. I'm a big hip hop fan, but not much into house. They had two dueling DJ's and an MC hosting the event. I actually liked the mash up of the two genre's. It was definitely better than just house.

They have about 5 beers on tap, which I think is impressive for a ""club."" Especially different since it was much more than Miller Light. They actually had a Pumpkin brew on tap, which forgive me for not remember, I was into! At $5.50 it wasn't breaking the bank, but it wasn't a $3 Miller Light fo sho!

When you make 3-4 trips per day back to the store, after realizing that the simple wiring of a light that you planned has evolved into an afternoon installation project, having someone who is nice about you returning parts and asking a million questions is such a stress reliever. If you need to use the bathroom when your plumbing at home explodes, you may get one or two odd looks if you bring a toothbrush, but even then the staff seems to have seen everything and maintains their nice and calm demeanor.

Tonight was a great example of I don't like the floor staff.  My vacuum stopped picking up anything but the largest pieces of dust.  After opening her up, I quickly realized I needed a new belt.  It was pouring down rain, but I put on my rainboots, grabbed an umbrella, and hoofed it over to ye ole Home Depot.  I had to stand over the shoulders of five--yep, I counted five--employees in appliances for a full minute before one of them would help me.

After someone directed me to the vacuum parts, I had two male employees stop by to see if I needed help as I searched for the correct belt.  I had the vacuum's name and number written down, as well as the belt style, and had the actual busted belt with me.  Yet, each of these men acted like I was some stupid girl.  ""Did you unplug the vacuum before you removed the old belt?"" one asked me.  Duh.  I'm not an idiot.  The other later asked, ""Do you always wear bright yellow rainboots when you're doing repairs?"" and snickered.  Look, all I said to both gentlemen was ""I'm just looking for the correct style number.  But thanks.""

I received similar treatment I stopped by to buy a new set of bits for my drill.  ""You know drills come in more than one kind, right?"" I was asked.  And when I needed a new bag of dirt of my cacti, I was question about why I wanted succulent dirt over potting soil.  Every time a male employee here approaches me, I'm questioned or given unsolicited advice in a snotty way.

This girl may wear bright yellow rainboots, but I am also the Norm Abram of my family.  AKA I'm pretty handy.  Oh, and the vacuum works perfectly now.

Customer service is about average. Some people are very helpful, others not so much. In general, they seem to be better than the Lowes at the Waterfront. At least HD people know where items are in the store. I can't tell you how many times I've received completely different (and wrong) answers to finding stuff at Lowes.

I would prefer a small hardware store (such as an Ace) closer to me for things like nuts, bolts, and screws. Ace seems to have a better selection than HD does for hard-to-find items. HD has most of the basics covered, however, and probably a little cheaper.

I generally avoid their paint section except for equipment. I prefer the service at a Sherwin-Williams or Masterwork Paint store. 

We've had decent luck with their garden department. We've had to return a few plants that died the day after we planted them, but they have never given us any problems with returns.

My only regret is that I didn't get a peace lily while I was there.   

I purchased my first ever air conditioner and I'm happy I did so at The Home Depot. I have terrible luck with appliances. In my experience no matter how much I pay , be it $30 or $ 300.00 my appliances always seem to stop running right after the manufactures warranty expires.  So I opted for the additional year of coverage which cost peanuts. I believe the additional protection it was less then $15.00 dollars.  

To this day I find it funny that my hubby and I purchased THE LAST PORTABLE AC the store had, remember guys this was last February. So apparently there was a run on ACs last winter.   Anyway it's still working great even after I dropped a screw inside of it on accident and I'm happy with my purchase.

My favorite section is the tool section seeing that I'm a DIY-er. (Do it yourself) if you didn't already know that.

They allow pets i'm assuming because i've never been asked to leave and I've seen others with their pets as well. 

That's the best part about the store is the animal policy and the fact that they offer enough supplies for you to practically build a house.

It's your standard Home Depot in terms of product selection, so there is nothing too notable in that regard. The customer service experiences I've had here have actually been mostly positive. Over the last several months, I've been going paint crazy in our house, so I'm pretty much on a first name basis with the guys at the Home Depot paint counter (it's kind of embarrassing that I'm there so much to the point where they know me, but whatever). Anyway, Jamaal and the rest of the paint department staff have always been very helpful, giving me tips and advice on paint color, type, tools, etc. They're patient with me when I request tons of paint samples (and I know how super annoying that is). Dare I even say that I look forward to getting my paint here?! 

As another example, we get our Christmas tree at Home Depot every year, and we've always been very pleased with how nice the staff has been in helping us tie it to our car. And just the other day my husband and I were in the plumbing aisle sizing up tools to help us unclog a drain, and an employee walked up to us and asked us if he could help. So nice. In fact, I can only recall one less-than-positive experience here, and it was when an employee mis-cut some wood for us (which we didn't know until we got it home and it wouldn't fit in our subfloor). So I guess the service hasn't been 100% perfect every time I've been here, but for a big box home improvement store, I've been very pleased overall. 

I do hate the parking lot though. Every time we go here, we pretty much count on the fact that someone will almost hit us, either while we're driving or walking into the store. Also, we have a compact car, but yet it seems like we barely fit in the parking spaces.

I have thoroughly enjoyed going each and every time. Some of the art they have on display is fantastic. It was interesting the last time I went because local artists were there to sell glass work they made.

The Make It Now classes are well worth $25. You get to be somewhat involved in creating the object (You get to pick the color, blow the glass, and do a couple of other things. You never get too hot to the ovens or do anything dangerous at all. If you want to be more involved, there are other more advanced classes that you can take), plus you have a wonderful piece of art to take home!

bKsf8kVnKZCpRT57JqrJ8Q,E2DyJFYYMY-A4nJDm0dYHA,"A few hours before the event, we happened across the ad in the City Paper and decided to give it a shot.  We were excited to get there as the event said we would be making something, there would be food and music, demonstrations, live music, and a gallery.  Booking our reservations for 6pm was quick and easy over the phone; $60 for a couple.  Upon arrival, we checked in and were asked if we wanted to purchase another item to make; we were confused because we assumed that we would each get to make something.  In the end, we chose not to spend the extra $15 to make another garden float/ornament; aka a hollow glass ball.  

When our 'instructor' met with us, he was very friendly but it was loud and he was very hard to hear.  He ran through everything at lightning speed and in the end, all we got to do was blow air in a tube for 10 seconds.  Had the first attempt not popped, I wouldn't even have been able to do anything!  From a teacher's standpoint, there were many other steps in the process that we should have been able to participate in; I would've been happy to sign a waiver if that is part of the issue.  Within 15 minutes, our ball was done and we were shuffled out so another couple could have their turn.

We then worked our way downstairs to the food and drink and there was an assortment of beer, wine, sparkling juices, veggies, fruit, cheese, and some deli meats.  The assortment was nice, as we were able to snack on the healthy side, but the beer was still warm.

The gallery was nice to walk through with work on display from so many talented people, the live music added to the ambiance, and the demonstrations were interesting to watch.

In the end, it was nice experience, but were severely let down by the make-it/take-it section of the evening (the part we were most excited for!).  It really started to bug us, when later in the evening, we saw an older couple getting to do more of the steps in the process (mind you, we aren't young kids, but young professionals).  We would have liked to have a small 'info talk' about the steps that will take place, why they are that way, the tools used, maybe some quick science behind it, then get to work on the item.",0,riqqVx-LssGUErBeQisKng,0,2,2013-08-20,review,0

The building is two floors and divided to about five different areas. The gallery is a cool space and each time I've been there was a different cool display. There are also different sized class rooms for working on different types of projects. Such as the hot shop, cold shop and framing shop. I highly recommend seeing the glass blowing demonstration in the hot shop. It's pretty cool to see being done.

My daughter was been several times and loves it as much as I do. One event she went to was a totally FREE event for teens called Play by the Fire. It gave them the chance to make art with local organizations including:

Assemble, were the teens got to build and test games using the scratch programming language and conductive materials. 

Carnegie Library of Pittsburgh, were the teens got to Learn the basics of Photoshop and become an all powerful fire Wizard with green screen.

Carnegie Museum of Art, were the teens got to document the fun of Play by the Fire while experimenting with retro Polaroid cameras and learn how Pittsburgh Biennial artist, Corey Escoto, manipulates Polaroid film and combines photography with other materials to make imaginative works of art that are currently on view at Carnegie Museum of Art. 

MAKESHOP at Children's Museum of Pittsburgh, were the teens got to create a short stop-motion animation. Create and use handmade props to build a simple set. And work with an overhead camera to tell a story frame-by-frame.

Manchester Craftsmen's Guild, were the teens got to watch current students demonstrate on the potter's wheel, as well as use an interactive Photo booth. Attendees will be able to print their own photos to take home. Current students demonstrating on the potter's wheel, as well as an interactive Photo booth. They were also able to print their own photos to take home.

The Mattress Factory, were the teens got to combine a small motor, battery, cool trash and a marker to create a beautiful and unexpected drawing.

Pittsburgh Filmmakers, were the teens got to explore creating their own surface pattern design repeats with hands-on collage techniques using 2D and 3D collage materials. For those who wanted to take it further got to use a scanner, Adobe Photoshop and color copies to visualize what they're pattern would look like as wallpaper, or fabric.

Pittsburgh Center for the Arts, were the teens got to create a unique jewelry pendant, earrings or key chain using the enameling process - the art of fusing glass to metal. The resulting objects combine the best properties of both elements: the strength and durability of metal with the shine and color of glass. 

Pittsburgh Glass Center, were the teens got to make their own glass paperweight, flower or pendant.

Union Project, were the teens got to watch live demonstrations and got a chance to go for a spin on the wheel.

The Warhol Museum, were the teens got to join artist educators from The Andy Warhol Museum in silk-screen printing and button making. Remix and collage imagery to make cool layered prints and buttons.

The teens also got to dance by music provided by Kelly Strayhorn Theater, Swag Monkeys and Tracksploitation and got to watch Andrew the Impaled, Pittsburgh's premier pain proof clown and performance arsonist.

They even got to eat furnace-fired pizza, gooey s'mores and more! My daughter absolutely loved the event and can't wait for it again this year. 

I love the Pittsburgh Glass Center but, must say that some of the prices for events are too high for most people to be able to afford going to the center very often. Maybe if they offered a Groupon or something like that. But, all in all, the Pittsburgh Glass center is a must see.",6,riqqVx-LssGUErBeQisKng,0,4,2015-01-14,review,7
9OZH1Ecw-qUkCW5MS0NefA,gNc6kmTR3j9tnnl9LR36Jg,"I'm always looking for unique ways to spend Valentine's Day.  This year, I celebrated by doing a make-it-now at the Glass Center with CM.  This event was held the evening of the day before Valentine's Day (2/13, a Fri.).  I'd been to the Glass Center in fall 2013 to observe an exhibition during RADical days, and had been meaning to try out a make-it-now, so this event provided the perfect opportunity to try my hand at glass craftsmanship as a novice.

For the V-Day event, you could choose between three items to make: a glass flower, a heart pendant, and a glass tile.  CM and I chose to make a glass flower, so upon checking into the glass center, we were told to go upstairs and check in at the hot shop.  Upon doing so, there was a 15-20 min. wait, given that many other couples were scheduled to do the activity at around the same time.  We passed the time by helping ourselves to some of the snacks that the Glass Center thoughtfully provided for participants.

When we were called, we worked with an instructor from the Glass Center (I forget his name) to make our flower.  He first demonstrated the steps involved in the process, explaining each of them in turn.  We then chose the colors and design of our flower, and proceeded to work with our instructor to carry out each of the steps.  He was very patient and helpful throughout the whole process, despite our characteristic clumsiness!  Despite the amount of people and molten glass in the studio, crafting our flower was a breeze and a lot of fun, thanks to his guidance!

After making our flower, we had to rush across the street because we had reservations for dinner at Verde.  After finishing dinner, we returned and observed the other make-it-now activities--the pendant in particular was fun to watch.  After they wrapped up, we went to the gallery to check out the glass art exhibit, which featured an arts program in Wilkinsburg.  We were even able to participate in it by adding to a mosaic that would be displayed at the program.  Finally, we checked out some of the glass art on exhibit by artists using the Glass Center in the foyer.

Overall, we had an amazing time making our flower at the Glass Center during the V-Day make-it-now, and strongly recommend it as a unique V-Day activity.  The price was reasonable ($35), the activity was fun, and the staff was friendly.  The only drawbacks were: (1) it was crowded, due to the popularity of the event, and (2) you have to wait three days to pick up your item so that it can cool properly. Obviously, however, there's not much the Glass Center can do about them, so I'm awarding 5 stars for one of the most unique and fun venues and activities in PGH!",13,riqqVx-LssGUErBeQisKng,6,5,2015-03-14,review,12

As soon as I found out about it, the spots were filling up quickly so my boyfriend and I signed up for a 5:45 class. We got there early because, well that's just who we are lol so we walked and got a cup of coffee and tried to warm up. When we came back, we went upstairs to where the class was and it was so warm and toasty up there! I could have fallen asleep!
""The guy with the clipboard"" as he referred to himself took our tickets and we had a seat to watch the other people making their flowers. We were teamed up with a guy (Matt, Joe... I don't remember his name, skinny, beanie, glasses) who helped us make our flowers. He was so friendly and talkative. He really took the time to explain the process to us even though people were waiting, I never felt rushed. 

After we finished making our flowers, I was slightly sad we weren't able to take them home that day, BUT our guy explained to us when we could pick them up and why were weren't able to take them home today (ie. glass explosion).

If you are new to the Pittsburgh area or are just looking for a new church to belong to then your search is over! 

One thing I love about Mt. Ararat is that it's not a black church or a white church, but it's a church for all people of all colors and races. Pastor Curtis is one of the best teachers and preaches I have ever heard! 

Men's bible study is on the first Monday of the month at 7pm. Regular bible study is on Tuesdays at 12 noon and 6pm. Saturday night live worship service is at 7pm. Sunday morning worship times are 7am, 9:30 and 11:45am. If you can't make it to Tuesday evening bible study or worship service on Sunday you can watch them on the churches website. 

There are even shuttles to pick you up in Oakland if you are a college student and would like to go Sunday worship service. 

Not to mention the Rement Choir is amazing. They came in second place in the 2009 National How Sweet The Sound Choir Competition! They have put out two Cd's. The second one, Only Jesus was recently released and it is amazing! 

They even have a separate youth worship service during the 11:45 service for children from six all the way to teenager's. 

If you go to the 11:45 service on Sunday you'll see me in the balcony during the spring and summer and at the 9:30 service during football season.

lGvan_bwem_ozi0oR7hnZA,BUEm0BzRbYk8a2B8Smwf6Q,"My experience was similar to Amy R. Midas installed a tie rod INCORRECTLY. I of course didn't notice (who looks at their tie rod after having one installed). When I had my state inspection done, my neighborhood mechanic found the problem and fixed it (which I had to pay for). I complained to Midas and they said that I should have had the neighborhood mechanic put my car back together and then drive the car to Midas to re-install the tie rod properly. Since I would have had to pay my mechanic labor anyway, and Midas had already shown that they didn't know how to properly install tie rods, this option made no sense to me. My car is working fine now (thanks to my neighborhood mechanic) but it was like pulling teeth to get any money back from Midas. It was only after I complained to the PA Attorney General that they refunded the money I paid them for the faulty tie rod installation. Like Amy R., they offered to give me a free service (I think it may have been an alignment). But my safety is important to me so I'm never letting them touch my car again. The Attorney General tried to get Midas to give me the money I had to pay my neighborhood mechanic (which I wouldn't have had to pay but for their ineptitude). However, Midas refused (the owner called me a liar, by the way), and the AG is merely a mediator and can't force Midas to do anything. The AG did, however, suggest that I file a civil claim with the magistrate and thought I had a good case. I chose not to because the filing fee is $94 and the potential upside was only $200 (with the downside being I lose the case and am out $94 in addition to the $200 I already paid). 

As an aside, I took our other car in for work a while back. My spare is under the trunk (you have to lift the carpet cover). I don't expect them to put everything back exactly where it was but it was as if they put on a blindfold and just threw things in as messily as they possibly could. I've NEVER experienced such a lack of consideration or professionalism.

DO NOT take your car to Midas!! They do faulty work that can jeopardize your safety. The are unprofessional and discourteous. They place NO value on customer satisfaction. Take your business elsewhere!!",0,FZ67NZD-_aou82e-7TT_nA,0,1,2015-02-12,review,0

WzaaorVCmUTQvu4mScunNg,K6WT0WA6Q0MTU3EXW_aocQ,"I hate to be a complainer, but these guys did such a half-asked job on my oil change (something soooo simple) i feel like i should give my 2 cents.

i made an appt online for 6pm the following day. The next day, the boss calls and says that spot isnt open, but if we needed high mileage oil, i could drop it off that night and it could get done the next day. That worked out perfect bc i work 9-5 and an actual appt before 6pm wouldnt be possible. Plus, our car is at 108k and needed high milage oil. So we drop off the car.... no envelopes or pens to write down information. luckily i found an envelope in our car and borrowed a pen from advanced auto across the street. 

So the next day we go to get the car. I asked if high milage oil was used. He said no because we didnt discuss it. (really?! -_-) I asked if they did the tire rotation. He said it wasnt needed.... Midas is known for complimentary tire rotations w/ an oil change so just do it instead of making BS excuses. I asked how the courtesy check went and he said everything came back ok which was also a lie bc we were told at our last oil change that the air filter will need replaced soon  and a week later the check engine light came on... so clearly the courtesy check wasnt done bc everything wasnt ok.  WHYYYYY do things half-asked? 

Finally we go to leave and i realize the sticker inside the windshield wasnt updated for the oil change (!!!!!!!!!!!)  We had to go back in and ask to get one printed. Seriously how to you mess up a simple oil change appt in multiple ways. 

Too many mechanics in east end. I'll go elsewhere if a quick-fix problem occurs. For scheduled maintenance, i'll stick with the Midas in Monroeville- they were helpful, honest & did everything the right way.",2,FZ67NZD-_aou82e-7TT_nA,2,2,2016-01-21,review,4

So this will be my first ever review online. I brought my truck in for a flat tire yesterday and an oil change. I dropped the truck off at 12:36 PM and was told it would take 2-3 hours. So I left the truck there. At 4:30PM I returned after work thinking it must be complete since it was 4 hrs later. At 5:00PM the front desk guy asked me if I was also in need a of an oil change (which I found shocking considering it was what I brought in for and was not even started yet.) 5:15PM I ask how much longer it was going to take. The front desk clerk said that it should not be much longer. I respond that it was to be completed almost 2 hours prior. He stated that that they were busy. Then he knew how busy they were when I dropped the truck off. So why was I not told an truthful time of how long it would actually take, so that I could decide if I wanted drop it off or not? At 5:30 he asked me what if I just wanted the tire in the bed of my truck. I responded that I wanted the tire put back under the truck. For some reason they translated that I wanted the spare tire on the truck and put the chrome tire back under my truck. At this point I'm starting to look for the hidden camera, thinking it has to be some sort of joke. Even when I told the clerk that that I had to pick up my daughter after school at 6 they seemed to move even slower. At one put I could see 3 of them gathered around a cell phone. 6:15 PM my truck is finally done. Was charged for full synthetic oil (even though i never asked for it).

We'd bought a few growlers of hard cider from a local establishment, and we were looking for some fuel to help us soak up the booze.  My friend suggested getting pizza from here, and I didn't object, since I'd never had pizza from here before, and I'd heard the pizza from here was consistently decent.

The pizza showed up about 45 min. after we ordered it, right about at the time estimated, so no complaints there.  As for the pizza itself, it was solidly A-OK--nothing special, but nothing horrible, either.  It was a bit on the greasy side, and I could tell from pulling the first piece away from the pie that the crust wasn't crispy.  Biting into my first slice of pepperoni pizza confirmed my suspicions about the floppiness of the crust.  As for the flavor, it was your standard pizza flavor--again, nothing special, but nothing horrible, either.  It was more greasy than I'd like, but not to the point where I felt it necessary to dab off the grease with a napkin (though I was tempted to do so).

As the bottom line, the pizza was fine for our purposes (to soak up alcohol). It was better than Vocelli's, and about on par with Papa John's.  I wouldn't go out of my way to order from here again, but I wouldn't object to it, either.",4,B9C6j80ob0f1pwi1Cnnd1Q,2,3,2014-10-04,review,5
yCVME7srvV4oC2bLj9TkAA,AYHCsKDmhEhFL59xNng6oQ,"I am not a mean person, not a vindictive person. I bear the friendly people of Pizza Parma no ill will.

But their pizza was remarkably terrible.

Went there, hungry, a bit past midnight, looking for a little something before going home to sleep. They don't have slices--this seems to be a (terrible, stupefying, egregious) trend in these parts. Fine. The smallest pizza, a ""personal"" pie, costs $7 and is 7"" in diameter. The cashier and I agree that that's a very small amount of pizza, and since I'm hungrier than one and one half mouthsful, I get a ""small,"" which is 10"". I add a mushroom topping. I pay my $11.21 and wait.

There are two seating options inside the store: a small wooden bench, and two fold up chairs around a little table. Conveniently, they were using the wooden bench to store a rolled up carpet that laid across the whole thing, and they'd also elected to fold up the two folding chairs, probably because they were tired from a long day of being used as chairs. So I waited outside the store on a bench.

The friendly cashier and the friendly patrons waiting for their order indoors called me over when my pizza was ready. I took it outside, sitting in the cold to eat it, thinking, ""I hope this $11 pizza is pretty good."" Opened up the box, saw how pitifully small a 10"" pizza is, and started eating.

Let me say something about pizza: if you have decent cheese, decent tomato sauce, flour, water, and a hot oven, you can make a passable pizza. I will eat it and think, ""well this isn't the best pizza I've ever had but it's fine."" That is not what I thought when I ate Pizza Parma's pizza. I thought, ""it would be too rude and insulting to ask for my money back. I'll just try to eat as much of this as I can.""

I ate three out of the six ""slices."" (One sixth of a 10"" pizza is a total of *25/6 = 13 square inches. That sounds like a lot of pizza, but in fact is a tiny amount of pizza.) I couldn't stand to eat more than half. The mushrooms were fine; I fished them out and ate them. The cheese was actually terrible; it had a strange chemical taste and plasticky appearance. The crust was poofy and not crusty.

Ashamedly, I threw half of a pizza away tonight. Folks, I am not a food destroyer. I eat things I don't like, and expired foods, because I don't want to waste. It takes a legitimately terrible pizza for me to actually throw the thing away.

Went home, made some eggs, and guess what? The terrible cheese taste from an hour and a half ago? It's still in my mouth. I'm not making this up.

I know there's good pizza around here. Ordered two back to back slices at Spak Brothers--delicious! Tasty! Reasonable price! But whoaaaaaaa whoa was this terrible, overexpensive pizza. Sheesh.",0,B9C6j80ob0f1pwi1Cnnd1Q,0,1,2014-12-16,review,1

The cheese and sauce on the pie was balanced nicely and not too saucy or cheesy.  Crust was quite thin, not too bubbly or voluminous. All in all I was very pleased with my Pizza Parma experience.

I spent days on the toilet after eating the pizza. My gut was a mess and calling a spade a spade, the pizza is overpriced for the quality or lack of quality, that is.

The hoagie was no better. Even my six year old thought it was horrid and that kid almost eats anything. 

I still recommend eating at other pizza places because I feel it's my yelping duty to save others from a gross, distrusting dining experience.

Since I have ironed through most of the places in Squirrel Hill, it's fun to try the other pizza places.  Maybe my friends and I hit Pizza Parma on an extra good night, but we thought the pizza was better than Pizza Perfecta just down the street.  Even better, Pizza Parma has a parking lot!

We ordered an extra large cheese pizza ($13.99 special) and an order of breadsticks ($4.99), and we were told the pizza would be ready in fifteen minutes.  They totaled $17.10 (lower than we expected from menu prices), and I threw a couple dollars in as a tip because the people working at Pizza Parma were so nice!  The man behind the counter was so friendly and everyone working here seemed to be happy.  Plus, our pizza was ready in ten minutes so score.

This was a pretty standard cheese pizza.  There was lots of cheese, which was great.  It wasn't overly spiced sauce nor was the crust special, but we enjoyed the pizza.  The breadsticks were good, but I wouldn't order them again.  They were the circular pizza crust kind, and I prefer the fluffy kind of breadsticks.  All in all, we will probably keep ordering takeout from here.

--Poor ventilation I could barely breath its cramped and small with dryers and washers lining two narrow corridors. 

---- misleading advertising it boasts ""high capacity"" washers an says its air conditioned, well the air conditioners and vents in the ceiling both were dripping in black dust and look like they were installed in 1963. which might have been why I felt an instant asthma attack coming on. 

Then the high capacity washers were all of 2.... not great enough to meet demand as it turns out one girl took up both of them while I was waiting.

Ugh laundry violation ya don't touch someone's wet clothes it feels like that time in college when someone would mess with you and dump your clothes behind the washers if you didn't move them out quickly enough. Sooo that pissed me off...... but I have to get the job done so I load up my clothes. 

I come back in to check on drying clothes.... and what do I find but my dryer mysteriously switched from high heat to low heat. Now I am forced to put in another quarter to finish my load.

If you are looking for a fancy laundromat, a place to hang out, or a place to put your clothes in and leave for an hour, this isn't the place for you.

If you are looking for a laundromat with machines that work just fine, low prices by comparison to other local laundromats, and timely removal, this is the place for you.

For me, I like to put my clothes into the washers (minimum 2.25 for the top loaders, 2.75 for greater capacity although it is rarely necessary), start them up, and go next door to the Turkish convenience store. Grab a Coke, go back to the laundromat, sit down with a book and read. 28 minutes go by, the machine beeps, and I move the clothes to the dryer. Throw three quarters in there and dry on high, and they're done in a little over 20 minutes. In total, a week's worth of laundry costs about 3 bucks, maybe 3.25 if you like your clothes scorching hot out of the dryer.

The machines are always clean when I go, and there's a parking lot in the back. Do your business, get out in under an hour.

Yes, the walkway is a little narrow between the machines, but that helps when you're transferring clothes. The floors aren't the cleanest, but you're not there for floors.

I attempt to drive to Whole Foods only to be caught in a line of 5-6 cars attempting to get into the parking lot.  (I guess I'm not cool enough to ride Pat Transit from the South Pittsburgh home).  When I find a place to park, after the Lexus SUV (HA!) pulls out, I find that they didn't put their cart back.  

So I enter the store and admire how their design is very appealing to the eyes (how DO organic oranges get so ROUND and so ORANGE) and everything is stacked so neatly.  Then I read that a pound of these oranges are $1.99...  Then I go to the meat section, which I don't even eat, to find that the prices are double those of Trader Joe's or even Market District (see future review).

There was tons of interesting looking stuff, and I found myself getting carried away and filling up my cart way more than I had intended.  I braced myself for the total in the checkout line and was pleasantly surprised when it wasn't much more than I typically spend at Giant Eagle.  On top of that, the produce stayed fresh for way longer than GE's typically does!  From now on I'm going to stick with WF for all my fresh produce needs (along with a few other specialty items -- some of their frozen Indian food is surprisingly good), but I'll still go to GE for my everyday grocery shopping.

NAp_p9-F-t9HxV68niH7TQ,EAbdMCCmnWqWas68BjLIHg,"Hello!

I work pretty close to Whole Foods so I frequent it about 3-4 times a week for lunch. If you're there M-F between 12-1, you can find me in the salad/bread area (on the north end). 

Compared to other Whole Foods I've been to, I would actually rate it a 3 but considering I do not know of any other Whole Foods around, I thought it's my duty to those that do not know about Whole Foods a chance to give it a try. If the zucchinis at Market District looked a little weak, give Whole Foods a try. Plus their pre-made food is actually yummy.

I'm able to keep my lunch on a budget by only buying lettuce and chicken from the salad bar (typically under 1/2 pound). I stash dressing, cranberries, and cheese in my office. I've tried buying the bag of pre-washed lettuce but I never finish them and I hate seeing them go bad. $3 lunches isn't bad at all.

Other notes: The tofu chicken is really good (part of the salad bar)! It's not always available though. Also, none of their bread varieties impress me. I like their sushi rolls. If I could afford $8/day lunches, I'd probably have it everyday. I'd give their cashiers 5 stars. =)",0,wfCLz9-aeShbPB7CaTY-qQ,0,4,2010-04-20,review,1

I'm a huge fan of the salad and hot bar - not a fan of the price though.

First off - I shop at ""Whole Paycheck"" cause my household eats organic and whether I like it or not WF has the best organic food prices in my neck of the woods. IT'S STILL GOD DAMN RIDICULOUS EXPENSIVE but I take my family units nutrition and health seriously! WORD!!

Downhill from here...

THE CUSTOMERS AND PARKING LOT ARE MORE BAT SHIT CRAZY THAN MENTAL HOSPITALS I'VE WORKED AT!

I have watched more rich bitch elderly women NEARLY murder pedestrians and crash into cars trying to park their Lincoln Continentals in that parking lot than I'd ever care to witness!

Also - I am a mother with a young child and have been SHOVED by above mentioned rich bitches while reaching for products out of the freezer cases WITH MY CHILD IN MY ARMS! I briefly entertained SHANKING said bitch but alas prison orange is not in my color wheel!

The customers are the worst human beings on earth (::thinks about self, shakes head, laughs...except me of course::). YOU KNOW WHO YOU ARE SHADYSIDE HAGS! You treat the employees like dogs - like one level above dirt. If I worked there I would hang myself in the cheese section! The customers are the worst cross section of Pittsburghers ever!!! 

That said- I understand why the employees are like stunned fish - keeping things close to the vest so that RICH BITCH SHADYSIDE MONSTERS don't feast on their flesh in fits of rage!

-Gdjho_gZhgTXkYmSPy0qw,2VM_YjgIdoLl7hrs7Ne_jA,"What's the most dangerous area in Pittsburgh--the Hill District? Homewood? Garfield? Wrong. it's the Whole Foods parking lot. Since I drive a Mini Cooper, it's considerably easier for me to zip around and dodge the Lexus SUVs that fly at you from every angle in this jungle of a parking lot, but I'm not sure how you people with normal-sized cars do it. Compounding the problem are the abandoned shopping carts rolling about and sometimes filling the already-limited parking spaces, thanks to the shortage of shopping cart corrals. Cold and tired, I found myself seriously considering abandoning my cart when I noticed that the nearest corral was on the other side of the lot. Don't worry, I didn't succumb to the temptation, but judging by the state of the parking lot, I think I'm in the minority.

If you actually make it into the store without any physical injury (you will be psychologically scarred, trust), there's definitely some good stuff to be had. As others have noted, the store is really small, causing the selection to be less than extensive. It's also too crowded. I like to spend a lot time in the grocery store checking out what's new and reading labels and such, but I feel awkward doing that when there's a swarm of soccer moms lurking over my shoulder and zigging and zagging all over the goddamn place. ANYWAY...some notes on various departments:

1. The produce here immediately stands out--it looks so much more appetizing and fresh than at Giant Eagle. Even the bagged salad greens are more vibrant. Unfortunately, it's a tradeoff for the smaller selection of produce, but they have all the basics covered.

2. This past trip was the first time I bought meat from Whole Foods, and the cuts were noticably neater and more consistent than at GE. Not sure if this is a regular thing, but they didn't have any filet mignon (I know, I'm high maintenance. I'M WORTH IT!).

3. The cheese department! I like how GE Market District organizes their cheese a little better, but Whole Foods has a much more interesting and varied selection.

5. The food bar is hit or miss. Some days it's the best thing ever, other days not so much. The sushi is gross. I always seem to forget this and try it over and over again with the same fishy, mealy results. Don't be stupid like me, avoid it.

6. Market District recently got rid of a lot of their natural & organic chip selection in favor of more varities of their store brand. Thankfully, Whole Foods has everything GE used to have and more, which totally makes the extra shopping trip worth it. If you're a fat kid like me, that is...

I don't come here for everything, but there are definitely some advantages here. Plus, the prices here are not THAT much worse than Market District in most cases. And I have no idea how I just wrote so much about Whole Foods?",2,wfCLz9-aeShbPB7CaTY-qQ,1,4,2011-12-09,review,1
yfRrC6MhxpIJ4-xMcrmk5Q,Kq-PU2_IdpF6ULOFfSrmUA,"I have a soft spot for Whole Foods.  I think it gets a bad rap, which I think is largely unfair.  I love food, and I know that sometimes things are legitimately ""overpriced,"" but just because something is expensive doesn't mean it isn't worth the cost.  So I don't believe in rating Whole Foods low just because their organic produce, ethically raised meat, and super hard-to-find ethnic ingredients cost money.  Nice things cost money.

This is not one of the glorious meccas - the Whole Foods in Lincoln Park in Chicago is definitely one of those - but this one is all right.  Pretty decent produce selection, and they always have some fun, mysterious finds.  I like their seasonal treats like meyer lemons, and their well-priced organic local produce throughout the summer.  Small fish and meat counter, but the quality is excellent.  My coworkers love the soups, and we all really enjoy the salad bar.  I love that I can find really unusual things here - their Asian section is small, but they always seem to have what I need.  And the prices on the Whole Foods store brand are really not that bad!  Seriously, like a can of beans will only set you back 99 cents, not that different from your Giant Eagle.  You can find affordable products here if you take the time.

I wish their bulk section was bigger, and I wish they had bulk spices because those make my life amazing.  Whole Foods is like, where I want to do all my shopping when I grow up.  I hate shopping at Giant Eagle, because there's no love and respect for the product.  It's just crap, and OVERPRICED crap spilling out of the aisles, begging for your attention.  Whole Foods has a lot of specialty products, made and sold by people who love to eat, and love to cook.  There's respect for the ingredients here.  To me, that's the best sign of a good grocery store.

If you don't have a lot of cash, like me, then it's good to only shop here when you need to (like for a weird cut of meat, some kind of unusual hot pepper or mushroom, flavored oil, rare cheese).  Every time you come, buy something new, just for fun.  There are so many surprises here!  I just wish it was bigger.

And yes, the parking lot is small and crowded, but like - so what?  Park in the back and walk a few extra feet.  It's not a big deal.",0,wfCLz9-aeShbPB7CaTY-qQ,0,4,2011-12-11,review,0

Cuz let's face it, how could I seriously compare this location to the original, gigantic, amazing, fresh, wonderful, healthy, gorgeous Whole Foods in Austin? Instead, I'll limit myself on reviewing the ever so friendly staff and parking lot. 

First, the employees. I've been to several Whole Foods around the country and I always got the impression that Whole Foods prides itself on customer service. Maybe this place is the exception? I was shopping here yesterday and a lady kindly asked an employee if she could squeeze in behind his veggie cart to grab something. The employee actually had the audacity to say, ""When I'm done"". And he did just that. He finished stocking his fruits and veggies and when he moved his cart and the lady thanked him, he didn't say a word. Also, the lady bagging my groceries didn't say one word to me. Not when I said hello. Not when I said thank you. Not even an ""ok"" when I said have a nice day. She didn't even smile at me! Where is the love? Actually, where are your manners?  I don't need you to love me, but don't be rude or ignore me. 

Second, the parking lot. I'm pretty sure this is the only Whole Foods in all of Pittsburgh. However, the parking lot seems to be built for Pittsburgh, population: 50. It's a small lot - good luck finding a spot without creepily following someone to their car and fighting an SUV for the spot. Luckily, I've never truly had a problem parking because I go at off times and park farther away. But I'm suspecting one of these days I'll come out and find my car dented or scratched. Maybe by a car, maybe by a shopping cart......maybe by the lady who was bagging my groceries yesterday....

So two stars docked for the above mentioned.  Other than that, I'll keep shopping here - after all, it's not like I have another choice when it comes to the Whole Foods of PIttsburgh.",2,wfCLz9-aeShbPB7CaTY-qQ,1,3,2012-01-05,review,5

The parking is atrocious, with only probably only 75 spots for a pretty popular store.  And have fun just getting into the parking lot from Centre.  Okay, I'm going to a negative place right now....

I stop in here one a whim when I'm out in the area if I'm really craving sushi, because it's way better than the Giant Eagle's sushi down the street.

Many Yelpers have docked stars for the parking lot. I think that's irrelevant. The parking lot, which is actually shared by Starbucks, Wine & Spirits, Walgreens, PNC, and more is two levels and is enormous! Walk a little. You can even take your cart up the elevator.

The Pittsburgh location is not a superstore. Other Whole Foods have a restaurant, brick oven pizzas, smoothie bar, coffee bar, many more food bars, wine, beer, and so forth. This is a teeny weeny Whole Foods. For its size, the selection is pretty impressive. For example, my mom saw something on Dr. Oz called Lingonberry Jam and asked if I would look for it, and there it was. Never heard of it before, but they had it. 

Whole Foods has that ""whole paycheck"" reputation. Granted, this is true if you're spending your whole paycheck on rare, gourmet, specialty foods! If that's the case, you might want to rein in your spending a little. 

I actually took a notebook to Trader Joe's, Giant Eagle, and Whole Foods when I first moved to Pittsburgh to compare prices. Giant Eagle (Greenfield location) was the most expensive by an overwhelming margin! Trader Joe's was the best value overall, but Whole Foods was very close, and sometimes a little better quality might be worth it. Their 365 brand is especially reasonable for your regular grocery staples.

As for the occasional splurge, this is a good place to try something different. I admit it's hard not to get something extra, but I know I can only blame that final total on myself!",1,wfCLz9-aeShbPB7CaTY-qQ,1,4,2012-01-28,review,1

RsaEvod4EOBYIdbRBBv0sw,lK5jb9nLykXS2l84z9Cpfw,"I'm in walking distance, which makes it my primary place to shop for food, and to crown myself as Le Duchess.  :-)  I also don't have to battle the SUV Soldiers looking for prime parking spots - because those people are CUT-THROAT and will most surely kill you (but seriously - they will.  I've been brushed on the leg and knee multiple times by cut-throat drivers in that parking lot.  I believe they would park INSIDE the store if they could).
I don't complain about the prices, because the food, and health benefits, are worth it in the long-term.  Not so long ago, I was forking out hundreds of dollars a month in prescription medications because my diet was HORRIBLE.  Since making the decision over two years ago to be more active and eat solely organic and Non-GMO, I'm off all of my medications, and the price of organic food is NOTHING compared to medications and prescriptions.  I'm actually saving money.  And No, I don't even make $20K a year - so it's all about choices.  I'm not ""rich"" at all, like most people assume, since I regularly shop there.  In fact, I'm usually dead broke.  But to me, eating whole and healthy and protecting my body is not a luxury, it's a necessity.
I also like that there is no pharmacy in Whole Foods.  That should say something.
My love for Whole Foods resides in the Organic Salad Bar, and Prepared Foods section.  Their salad bar is so fresh and so delicious, that eating salads anywhere else becomes TASTELESS.  Organic makes all the difference.
My favorite Prepared Foods is their Vegan General Tso's ""chicken"".  Little popcorn nuggets of Seitan, drenched in the best General Tso's sauce I've ever tasted, with steamed broccoli.  Molly's Sesame Noodles on the salad bar is our favorite side dish to this prepared foods treat.  I swear we eat it at least once a week.
We also love their Bulk Section where we can get bulk quinoa, granola, lentils, and all kinds of things for a really decent price.  
The secret to shopping at Whole Foods?   BUY WHAT YOU NEED TO EAT THAT DAY.  It's not smart to bulk shop organic produce, because it goes bad faster.  Buy what you KNOW you're going to eat.

UFem4aIQoL9MtejCZQ6YDg,mZMn-2CY_a6GflyI9s5k6Q,"I have tried Whole Foods recently even after hearing about the attitude of the butthole, hipster employees and presumptuous, bourgeois customers that will literally push you aside a turn their noses up at you a million times. The rumors were true!!! 

Even though I was only there one time, first impressions are a bitch! The selection is great! I can't afford any of it, but it's great! I have never seen such expensive rice! Here is the bro-down...

The food: Plentiful and too expensive to even think of buying. The freshest fish that isn't in the Strip...but you need to take a second mortgage to buy fish for a family. I bought sushi rice, a piece of fish and a salad, my bill: $25! The salad with lettuce, carrots, chick peas, onions and about 5 pieces of chicken was $11+

The employees: Hipsters with thick-rimmed glasses, tattoos and facial piercings that slack like I have never seen ""workers"" slack before. In fact there was a sign above some fresh fish stating ""We will prepare you fish any way you want, just ask"" HA...HA! When I asked to have a tiny fish to be filleted (something that would take me about 10 seconds at home) I was scoffed at by the so called fish monger who was obviously not a trained fish monger, but got his job because of his Progressive music of the soviet era bachelors degree . It took him the better part of 20 minutes to fillet a f-ing fish! All I got was a chopped up piece of crap that was useless. And scoffing is what these people are good at. Pushing your cart down the aisles is like running a scoffing gauntlet. Staff huff and puff when you get in their way?! The cashiers just stand and talk to each other or run to get organic iced tea to drink WHILE they ring you up...they don't even do that at Giant Eagle!

The other customers: This one is a peach! If you're not pulling in a good $60K a year you are dirt to these people. I was at the salad bar (it is a good salad bar, but expensive) an older woman in a mink coat bumped, no, pushed into me then stared at me and turned her nose up at me, can you believe it? She actually turned her nose up at me! Others in the aisles will grunt like cantankerous old people if they can't get through. They push ahead in line, give you dirty looks, and act like it's a class struggle...it kind of is!

So unless you have a lot (i mean A LOT) of disposable income, have never needed to use coupons, drive a $50K car (parking is terrible there), are the president of the United States, CEO of Microsoft, a widow whose wardrobe is more extensive than the explanation of the formula explaining an event horizon or a hipster who looks poor, but lives off daddy and mommy (though they'll never admit it) you shouldn't and really won't be able to afford this place...but why would you want to?

I'll stick with Trader Joe's for my alternative market, thank you! I prefer employees with edges that are a little rough to ones with pants so tight, I can see their junk.",1,wfCLz9-aeShbPB7CaTY-qQ,3,1,2012-05-12,review,2

You pay a premium at WF, you expect a premium, right? Well parking is part of the shopping experience. It's why they have parking lots in the first place. But never mind the atrocious parking lot and not being able to easily maneuver in it.

I'm talking about being TOWED. Towed, not for leaving the parking lot, but for legitimately shopping at WF. Yes, this could happen to you too.

Upon contacting the towing company, they demanded $135 (cash only) to return my vehicle. Upon contacting WF (since I was a legitimate shopper there and didn't leave the lot) they just shrugged their shoulders and just told me the name of the company that managed the lot.

And that's it?! $135 is no chump change, but it seems like WF wants me to carry an extra $135 every time I frequent them (thankfully, never, since I don't live in Pittsburgh). This whole parking/towing situation is extremely shady, but the only company I'm going to point my finger at is Whole Foods for doing business with such a shady complex and passing the burden on to its customers.

From that perspective this place just gets two stars.  Some items were higher priced but the value added (from organic to vegan certified) would I guess justify it if you had to have it.  But the items that do no fall under any of those premium-restriction value types are still just as highly priced.  So it feels like 90% of their inventory is priced at a whole-store experience premium.

After I taught a yoga class.  I know, I know, I'm such a white liberal yuppie, it's painful.

The meat, seafood and vegetables always look fresh and last a whole lot longer than the stuff from Trader Joes or Market District. Plus you don't have to look at the label for any of the ingredients cause you know the food does not have corn syrup or a derivative of it. 

While my shopping at Whole Foods mainly extends to meats, seafood, vegetables/fruit and milk/eggs, I sometimes crave their assortment of cheese and I'm a big fan of the bakery section. They do custom orders (I think) with names etc. for birthdays/Valentines Day.  

Tip: You get 2 dozen red roses for Valentines Day for 20 bucks. Now that's a steal!

This is a small store compared to what I have been used to. The parking lot sucks considering the traffic it gets (there is a salon in the same lot so that adds to the mess during weekends).

I docked two stars for absolutely terrible parking - yep.

Whole Foods does have better lighting and layout than GE, and yes, a more discriminative selection of products, especially for people with specialized diets, like vegans (me) and gluten free adherents. The house baked bread here might be worse than GE (tough contest) - often under baked and thus soggy in middle and crusts tend to fall off; making gluten free-dom seem appealing.

I love how when you first walk in the store, your automatically thrown into the produce section no questioned asked. The store is practically laid out to help you make the best food purchasing options available.

They have more organic foods than any other store i've seen. Everything looks so fresh and plentiful. They also have conventional (non-organic) items that are usually shipped locally and not from across the country. Tons of options from Bok Choy to avocados to seasonal fruits. They have a fresh seafood counter and a meat counter with ratings on the meat from one to five. There is also a deli counter with fresh pasta salads and side dishes made in store. 

I recently started a gluten free diet and this store meets all my needs from bread, buns, cereal, crackers, basically all the common wheat products. I've substituted out a lot of wheat products like flour and instead use rice flour, regular milk for almond milk, things like that.

Everyone is in each others' way and trying to be the first one to find the best organic orange or grab the last package vegan general tso's in the store.

Of course, if you're at Whole Foods your'e likely there for the organic options, and as to be expected, you're not going to find a better selection anywhere else. More unique, perhaps, but their inventory just won't be matched any time soon for those foods.

There is also a large selection of dips, spreads, and large take-away sides as well. I think their prepared foods are worth every penny, and if you don't load up your salad with heavy items, you can easily get a dinner-sized salad with a little meat or egg for $8 or $9.

Some of my favorite items at this location include the fresh fruit packaged in containers. It's super expensive, but always fresh and delicious, and I love treating myself to it, especially during the summer.

I just wish they would give us a break on the prices.",0,wfCLz9-aeShbPB7CaTY-qQ,0,3,2014-06-16,review,0
YF42eCvUn1hj9oFUpBsOVQ,3OE4tMVib7RLRw1Ecn1poQ,"All that I can say is WOWSA!!!!!!!!! This review is long overdue! I will state it outright that I'm very particular about my food, and I've been known to stomp my food like a brat when my heart's set on that vegan tofu burrito from the fresh pack section and it's not available. 

A few months ago, when this happened, I sulked at the Prepared Foods counter, and Bethany, prepared foods customer service extraordinaire, flew to my rescue. She suggested the vegan BLT. I was hesitant, as I wanted something hearty and filling, and let me tell you this!... The sandwich totally did her smile and sales pitch justice. It pleased me like no other sandwich has ever done. I want to compliment every sandwich maker in that department, specifically Bethany, Eric, and Rick. They know when I walk in their direction from the Fresh Pack section that I'm looking for my second option of the BLT because the burrito isn't available. No matter how bananas and certifiably insane I might seem during my food shopping excursions, they always treat me with such dignity and respect.

Months have passed since my first BLT experience, and I was completely taken for another ride through satisfaction land during this past week when they offered to notify me ""the night before when the vegan tofu burritos are being made"" because they know how much I have my heart set on that beautiful meal on most days of the week. I can't say enough for Bethany and her team of prepared foods colleagues. 

And everyone else at the store is so helpful and nice, too! So kind! So informative! I love Whole Foods Market of Pittsburgh! AND, for icing on the review cake, they've even begun to carry Brad's Raw Pizza Kale Chips for dogs. So my dog is satisfied, too. And it's her opinion that ultimately matters. ;) Five stars!

RSExP0-Boucr4QyIEzZi0A,bUaPRLK4U7eusIPbw23i6A,"So..... when I think about shopping at Whole Foods, I always create an alternate universe where I think I would be able to shop here. I think: if I made at least twice the amount of money I currently do, I would be able to be a member of the club and shop here. .... but I don't. Thus, I only stop in here on very special occasions when I 1. can withstand the rage I feel when I pull into this parking lot; and 2. I want to either eat at the buffet or buy a very specific item. I would definitely recommend that others stop in sometime to get some food at the buffet. The quality of everything is pretty incredible (though of course it's typically really expensive).",1,wfCLz9-aeShbPB7CaTY-qQ,0,3,2014-07-07,review,0
jR_zE_9TEcY4_vrTeKNXlA,ZSwfgd5h9-W5FdWrelBjWg,"I love Whole Foods, and I have been a fan for a few years now. I've visited Whole Foods locations around the country, but this Pittsburgh location is one of my favorites. It's a small store, but it feels homey and comfortable.

Staff: Most of the staff members are super friendly and willing to do just about anything to help you find what you are looking for. I had one staff member begrudgingly help me out, but I assumed he was having a bad day or was very busy. Either way, it's nice to treat others with respect. 

The cashiers here are so fantastic. They are never rushing and throwing food into bags. They take their time, ask you questions and treat you like a person instead of another number in a long line. 

Deli/Made-To-Order: The deli and made-to-order foods are currently my favorite. Sometimes I would rather spend $20 on lunch here with my boyfriend than go to a restaurant or get fast food. My favorite is the vegan chicken salad on foccacia bread. I adore this bread. It's just the right texture, it's nice and herby and deliciously buttery. Topped with swiss or muenster, it's a super delish sandwich. If I am extra peckish, I get extra veg. chicken salad. Yum yum yum! 

The tomato bisque they have is something I newly tried. I'm very picky about my tomatoes and tomato products. This soup delivers. I wish I could have it every single day. It's so phenomenal! My boyfriend got it today alongside a cheddar biscuit that paired beautifully with the soup. 

Cheeses: If you want fancy gourmet cheeses, the Whole Foods deli counter might be the best choice. We purchased a small amount of Midnight Moon Goat Cheese Gouda and made the most expensively delicious grilled cheese sandwich. We're grown-ups now, say goodbye to gross American cheeses! The cheese counter is so great because all of the cheeses are labeled with the kind of rennet used in the processing. You can easily find a high-quality vegetarian cheese with just a glance. The cheese experts are also willing to talk cheese to you for as long as you like. 

Store Selection: Overall the store has great options, but they don't carry everything that I wish they did. Unfortunately, they discontinued one of my favorite products - Field Roast Deli Slices. They bring in new and trendy foodstuffs though, so it's enough to keep me happy. 

Whole Foods can be pretty expensive, but if you don't fall for the tempting packaged foods, you can get away with a reasonable grocery bill! I primarily shop here for special items though. 

P.S. Their selection of natural body and haircare is great and affordable. If you have sensitive skin or don't want your products tested on animals, go here!",4,wfCLz9-aeShbPB7CaTY-qQ,2,4,2014-07-07,review,2
C3MHaW2n0GBi5l5TcZuZPA,enWLsxACY6BciN1nJO9Ehg,"My expectations for Whole Foods Market had been established as was growing up in the DMV (D.C., MD, VA) area. Thus, very fresh produce, high-quality meats, diverse cheeses, expansive bulk section, novel food items, exceptional food bars, and excellent customer service were essentially a given. On the other hand, I also expected parking difficulties, even at stores with multi-story garages.

The Whole Foods Market in Pittsburgh is not much different from those in the DMV area. However, the parking is horrendous! Really, a medium-size private parking lot for the only Whole Foods Market in the Pittsburgh area right along a congested major road? Let me say that Whole Foods Markets in D.C. are also close to major roads, but they at least have underground or aboveground garages and fairly decent road infrastructure to accommodate for the influx and outflux of shoppers. I would love if the Pittsburgh store can build a garage of some sort (I'm not counting the garage next to the Starbucks and Walgreens) with smooth entry and exit so as to prevent a mini-gridlock along Centre Avenue.

Parking situation aside, the Pittsburgh store does live up to my expectations established from the DMV stores. You will rarely find a bad apple (no pun intended), and the store usually keeps shelves stocked (except when there is a major sale or promotion going on). Now, if only its prices and my budget could meet halfway so I could frequent this store more--via bike or my own two feet.",0,wfCLz9-aeShbPB7CaTY-qQ,0,3,2014-09-14,review,0

Ladies, DO NOT ever go there hungry, or on your period that has your horns out due to the most beautiful thing we get ""cramps"". First off the parking will make you want to rip your steering wheel apart, and throw it at the person ahead of you that got the last parking space. Parking is MADNESS!!

Then after you find a parking spot from doing bumper cars with other non-driving asses. Here comes another traffic jam (carts, and people). The space in there is one big box. Geez Louise. 

I cringe when I have to go there to get an item that only WF carries. But I like how they trap me with their delicious fruit and vegetable display as soon as you walk in. It's a war zone in that area. I can understand organic being more expensive than conventional, but why oh why is their conventional JUST AS expensive as their organic? REALLY?!?! So every time they get me with their fruits, veggies, and the only place that I have found to sell skinless drumsticks, along with 2 or 3 more items. My bill is ALWAYS 90.00!! OMG!! I only got 1 bag of groceries!! The fruit that sells by the pound be like 8 to 9 dollars. I just can't. 

On a more positive note. The employees. They have always been so great to me. Always greet me with a smile, and if I have an item that has a coupon, they go out of their way to get the coupon so I can save (lol at save) oh my haha.

I would say everything I got from the salad bar to the hot bar was good apart from they had run out of soup/special of the day and the chicken was beyond dry, the time I spent in the dessert was a wet oasis compared to the chicken. I just feel that for the price I paid it was not worth it. I have been to a smaller whole foods with a better hot bar and to the one in New York City and remember it being great. I only give this one 3 stars because the Mac n cheese and vegan tofu loaf was rather good. But I must repeat myself about the price. For what I got it's way to much. It's hard to justify paying that much when I could make it for 1/5th the price at home. Now I know I don't have to cook or clean and that's the point of eating out but I could also go to trader joes get a few frozen meals and eat for over a day for the price of one hot bar meal from whole foods.",0,wfCLz9-aeShbPB7CaTY-qQ,0,3,2014-09-24,review,0

But that parking lot.  Good Lord it's like playing bumper cars.  And from the YouTube video where the guy sings, ""It's getting real in the Whole Foods parking lot"" I realize that Pittsburgh's Whole Foods is not special - this is a common problem.  Small spaces, not enough parking, too many people driving through fighting for a spot, yeah, it's a mess.

It's almost always crazy busy in here.  I believe I'd come more often if the shopping experience was calmer.  But because of the insanity of the parking lot and the hectic shopping (people everywhere bumping into each other)  that takes place inside, I truly limit my shopping here.  To like once a year. But when I do venture in I think they have a fab hot food section and great sushi.  Some pretty tasty baked goods as well.",0,wfCLz9-aeShbPB7CaTY-qQ,0,3,2014-09-26,review,2
j2UOrL-m5tvtqKXV4-RkYw,b7P5nd_h0pPRXgen24iqKA,"Yes, the parking lot in crazy. Yes, the prices are outrageously high (it's not called Whole Paychecks for nuthin'). Yes, the store is small and usually crowded and the majority of the people who shop who here completely unaware they are NOT the only people on the planet. All those things aside, I love Whole Foods. Most of the issues can be handled by slight changes in habit. For instance, park farther away instead of circling the GD parking lot for the closest spot!!! I get so sick of people complaining about that damn parking lot when all you have to do is park by Walgreens and walk. Seriously, the walk won't kill most of us. Stop being lazy. (Sorry, for the tirade; that's a pet peeve of mine). 

The produce is fantastic, always. And not just the organic stuff either. The regular pesticide-laden produce is great. The quality of the meat department is second to none. Now, the bakery is a little 'Eh' for me. The muffins and cookies and cakes always look De-Lish!, but they aren't. Usually to dry or dense or flavorless. It really doesn't matter because the star of the show is...

The HOT FOODS BAR. The quality and taste of most of the hot foods/prepared foods bar is unbeatable. I lovelvoelove the breakfast bar. My dream weekend starts with waking up and taking a nice long walk, stopping for coffee then heading on to WF to pick up Eggs Rancheros Burritos and Sausage patties from the breakfast bar. I may get creamed by a bus the second I leave, but I will die happy. 

Some of my other favorites are a Vegan General Tso's ""chicken"" that has the BEST real chicken texture. It's really good! The mozzarella pasta salad, Sicilian cauliflower and the egg rolls which are seasonal. Don't forget to check out the packaged hot foods across from the salad bar; same stuff but pre-packaged. 

As a note though, the chicken fiesta soup is nooooot good. Bland with a capital B! In general the soups are hit or miss, but a real hit is the triple squash or Butternut squash, something like that. It's next to sushi. It's very good",0,wfCLz9-aeShbPB7CaTY-qQ,0,4,2014-10-09,review,0

One thing about Whole Foods is they specialize in fresh fruits and vegetables.  Their produce is definitely impressive. All of the oranges, lettuce, berries and bananas peppers are perfectly ripe.  They never have spoiled or bad fruit.

The pastry section is definitely worth checking out.  They have fruit tarts and a lot of different flavored cheesecakes and cannolis.

MSuyK2p8G9hEqyWf5IgnYQ,-aH7MhKH-RTcQ7pBs07ZEA,"I have such mixed emotions about whole foods. I first visited whole foods in February of this year.. In my opinion, it is a little overwhelming at first and here's why. Like most People in the US, I was brought up on all of the ""typical"" mainstream American food brands. So when I walked into this place and barely recognized any brands, it was slightly overwhelming. It took a little research and I still do some research on some products before making a trip. I recommend going online and checking their coupons before making a trip - I tried a bunch of new products that way. I have also googled ""best snacks at whole foods"" to get some more ideas of what to try. 

Now here's the sucky part- overall, whole foods is pretty overpriced. BUT I will say that it is not ENTIRELY their fault. They sell higher quality products than your average grocery store. Mostly all of their products are made with the best ingredients and are often organic and gmo free. They are vegan and vegetarian friendly and have tons of options for people with allergies. If companies are spending more money on better ingredients , they are going to have to sell their products for a higher price. 

Having said that, tazo tea for $4 a box is not a sale. I went a couple weeks ago and saw the sale price advertised, did a quick google search and realized target sells their tazo tea for $3.50 NOT on sale. Needless to say I took the trip down the street and saved myself some money for the tea. I also recently wanted to purchase kale chips that I heard so much about (brand is called brad's raw and the flavor was vampire killer)... Until I realized they were $9 for 2 oz ! You can get fresh kale for less than half the cost! 

Although whole foods can be expensive they aren't ALWAYS that bad. My favorite yogurt, wallaby organic yogurt, is sold here. On a normal day, it cost $1 each. A couple days ago, they were 89 cents each- not bad for organic yogurt. They also have an amazing selection of uniquely flavored chocolates and they are pretty reasonably priced. Justin's organic peanut butter cups are incredible! 

The customer service has  always been awesome in this particular location. I hear that whole foods is very willing to take back anything that you don't enjoy , as long as you have your receipt. 

as other yelpers have said- the parking sucks in this location, it's a nightmare. So keep that in mind before you visit.

This is also a great place to find a great assortment of cheeses and grass fed butter ( I go for the kerry gold products, they are just awesome).  

Also if you are grilling and dont want to cook too many sides, you can pick up some of their sides from their deli section. I haven't had a bad experience with their food and you can always give everything a taste before having the clerk put it in a container.  This is certainly the place to get specialty items like hemp seeds, chia seeds, and other natural dietary supplements... just beware they are not cheap.

The quality of the produce and the meat cannot be matched anywhere in the city, unless you go down to the Strip. But hands down my favorite thing about going here are the employees.

ROW8AGe3O4QB0WBvJriTmQ,AsMEdErIgC700hOdlN-3KA,"My favorite grocery store in Pittsburgh. When I lived with my parents in forest hills it was worth the 15 to 20 minute drive to shop here. Lots and lots of organic produce. Everything you would need to stock your fridge and pantry plus lots of more exotic options too. Much of the produce comes in conventionally farmed and organic options so pay attention to the labels and signs if you're aiming for all organic. It is more expensive to shop here than most grocery stores but you really do get what you pay for. 
The bulk section has lots of nuts, seeds, beans and grains.
The meat counter looks pretty great with some grass fed and organic options (a bit out of my price range for every day eating but its good to know its there for a special occasion). Their seafood counter is passable (that being said, I worked at Wholey's fish market for a while so I have really high standards when it comes to seafood. Not that Wholeys fish always meets my standards, but I'm used to huge variety and at least a few incredibly fresh options). Much of the seafood is previously frozen because it's out of season or exorbitantly expensive when fresh. I honestly can't believe people who shop at whole foods have any interest in irresponsibly farmed fish like tilapia and Chilean Atlantic salmon but they carry it nonetheless. 
Staff are friendly but can't always answer what you might think is a simple question. As in the bulk foods guy probably knows everything about the bulk foods but literally has no clue where you can find horseradish.
Salad bar and hot foods are good and seam fresh. The sushi is passable if you're really in the mood for quick sushi. There's not a very big baked good section and I've never tried what they do have but my dad likes their cookies. 
I usually bike there now, but when I used to drive the parking lot was sort of a mess. Just be prepared to walk from the far end (I'm sure you'll all survive).

A few weeks ago I was really sick and came in to pick up a cold remedy, lunch, and orange juice.  This Whole Foods is just not quite up to the national standard.

First, this Whole Foods is fairly small, but the parking situation is a disaster.  There is not adequate parking, and the kind of people who shop at this particular Whole Foods are the worst people ever.  People will try to run you over in the parking lot to get the last spot.  It's actually pathetic.

The store is set-up a bit odd, and the employees aren't particularly friendly here.  I felt like I was begging someone to find Sambucus, which just isn't fun when you don't feel well.  However, the cashiers were up to par.

The biggest kick in the face was the prepared foods section.  At 11:00 AM on a Thursday there was no prepared food set up.  No soup, no entrees.  Just some leftover Oatmeal that had hardened from breakfast and the name tags for the prepared food that would eventually come out.  There are only two small serving stations as well, and a lot of my favorite options were missing, like the mac and cheese.

But the experience is just... unpleasant. Humans in BMW's/Audi's/beat up subarus have turned into vultures, circling... waiting... for the next spot to open up in the impossibly tiny lot. There are no words to describe the anguish of being stuck behind one of these vultures stalking a shopper with a full grocery cart, only to see a spot just ahead, that someone else pounces on while you helplessly look on. It sounds trivial and I get that this is a city, but is this what one really wants to deal with as they are trying to run errands on their day off when there are other, less stressful options near by? 

And, you know, I think the trauma of trying to find a parking spot remains with the shoppers long after parking their car because people the atmosphere is kind of stressful inside as well. The jockeying for the shortest line in the check out, the pushing people out of the way for the last organic horseradish root... it's about the same as any other urban grocery store but after the parking! Knowing the dangerous gauntlet I must run to get back to my car with my groceries! The prices! It's just not worth it. 

And I'd be willing to forgive all of this if it were an above average Whole Foods, but it's not. This brings me, at last, to the turkey. I called ahead in late October TWICE to make sure the turkey I ordered would be fresh for Thanksgiving. It was supposed to be fresh. It was labelled fresh. But it was frozen. If I'm going to pay 60 bucks for a bird, it really should come as labeled and advertised. I don't need the stress of hoping my bird will thaw before the big day (spoiler alert... it won't). Especially not after the parking lot.

EDIT: Well, customer service was awesome and they refunded my frozen turkey. I amend to 3*... thanks customer service!",0,wfCLz9-aeShbPB7CaTY-qQ,0,3,2015-11-23,review,0

The store itself is very, very hard to navigate- it seems to always be super crowded.  I've never used a buggy, only a basket, and even trying to maneuver that is a nightmare.  In my opinion, there's just too much going on in the space that they have; food displays at the ends of aisles, sample tables, seated tables at the front...and no room to actually shop.

Whole Foods Market does not carry any items with 'partially hydrogenated oils', for instance. It's upscale for quality products.
If you're watching your budget,  then look
for sales, their own 365 brand, and take a little longer time to shop there. You will do fine.

This location, as countless other posters have mentioned, is stuck with a tiny parking lot which makes for congestion and Frogger-esque pedestrians. There is a Starbucks across the way which is nice to have while shopping. The store typically has some displays out front of fresh herbs, fruit or flowers. Upon entering bins of conventional and organic fruit are laid out next to a wall of fresh vegetables, mushrooms and herbs. I would like it to see clearer labeling of what is organic versus conventional however. 

Moving past the produce area is the fish monger displaying fresh tilapia, catfish, cod, sea bass and more. There are a few seafood based soups as well. All fantastic quality. Past the seafood offerings you will come to the meat department. There is a nice section of grass-fed beef which I definitely recommend (typically $9.99/lb for ground beef). 

The rest of the store offers plenty of organic selections as you would imagine as well as providing a high-alkaline water fill station, an assortment of domestic and international cheeses and a fresh hot foods section. Also included are the deli and bakery.

So when it came time to get the oil changed in my new-to-me 2010 Honda Civic, I turned to Yelp to help find a place with a solid rating. As far as oil-changing joints go, this AAMCO location stood out among others in the East End. Here's why it gets a high rating in my book...

I called two days ahead of time to schedule. They could take me early Friday morning-- the sooner the better. Well, I was out late celebrating a birthday the night prior and overslept. I called back to reschedule for another day, but they were able to squeeze me in in the afternoon. I went in thinking I was going to be dropping $80 for synthetic oil, but Brian, the shop manager and co-owner is a Honda guy himself and said regular oil would work just fine. I asked him if he could check out the condition of my brakes and tires. Instead of doing a quick visual, he took the tires off to check. Moreover, he rotated them, so my best tires are up front, where they should be. All told, the bill came to under $40 and I was in and out in under an hour.

Along with his business partner, Jim, Brian took over the AAMCO in the latter half of 2014 and he officially became a co-owner on 1 December. He has years of experience working on cars, first as a hobby, and then after a long time in the restaurant business, as an employed mechanic. The customer service was great. I was greeted promptly and with a handshake. After returning to pick up my car, Brian and I spoke for about 10 minutes after the shop had closed for the day. He has plans to renovate the shop to make it better for both his customers and employees, as well as to offer deals through social media.

I'll need tires soon and brake job down the line-- I'll be returning to AAMCO for both.

After receiving their threatening letter ""reminding me"" of the lease I regretfully signed, my fiancé called them to ask why  they were taking pictures inside our apartment without our knowledge.

If you have pets, don't even bother renting from any of their properties. Pet deposit/rent is ridiculous. I get harassed that my dog needs to be crated when I'm gone. Oh they even suggested I put my baby in doggy day care, how the **** am I supposed to afford that when I'm paying a security deposit, pet deposit, rent, and pet rent? I've basically been told I'm not getting my security deposit back.  Their reasoning that my dog has to be crated is for the SAFETY of their maintenance guys. My dog is a 10 lb papillon.

My parents feel the same way about it.  It is a good, if unspectacular place with reliable, tasty fare like honey chicken, Chinese flank steak, and authentic eggrolls.  

I don't normally go for the spicy fare, indeed I prefer the plainer dishes like chicken with vegetables, but they have one item on the menu that I've always wanted to try--Sau La Gi, which is stir-fried hot spicy chicken, onions, green onions & fresh bean sprouts.  Perhaps I've never noticed, but I don't recall seeing it anywhere else.  It was good, but Hoo-Boy did I have to pace myself while eating it.  And have plenty of water nearby!  Sau La Gi was worth trying once, but it really wasn't to my tastes and I doubt I'll have it again.

My friend Maryann tried  Ching Za Gai (spicy also) which is roasted crispy chicken served with tangy vinaigrette sauce.  I sampled it and perhaps I will order that for myself next time.  I'd like to cook a milder version of it myself at home.  

More to my tastes however are the Garden Chicken, Chicken with Broccoli, or Beef with Pea Pods.  Seafood dishes include Sweet and Sour Shrimp and  Sauteed Shrimp Szechaun Style.  Yeah, I'm a little unimaginative when it comes to Chinese food, but I know what I like and if a place can do the basics right, it's okay in my book!

e7iHB7gZbVuD-UvJVKe3cQ,XCFgcqUWrTr_dkm9AOgs7A,"This is a cut and paste from a review I wrote on apartmentratings.  

I read the poor reviews for Kamin, but decided to reserve my judgement of their places until I saw for myself. I must say that after my experience today, I'm thinking that the reviews here are far from hyperbolic. 

I was scheduled to see two units today - one on Walnut and one on S. Negley. When my boyfriend and I arrived at the first place, the building manager, Paul informed us that we could just look at the unit on Walnut Street because, ""They are identical apartments...Same builder and everything, but if you want to fight against traffic this time of day, we can."" First of all Paul, the floor plan may be the same, but no two units are alike. The kitchen may have been updated in one or maybe the bathroom tile was different, the building may smell different and maybe a potential tenant wants to see the view out the window. Secondly, if we're going to potentially sign a lease to pay almost $1,400 per month, we'd at least like to see the actual unit we'd be living in. In addition to that, the other apartment was only three blocks from this building. We felt that the 8 minute walk would not be that terrible of an inconvenience (for us anyway, but then again Paul seemed to be in a hurry.) 

Anyway, we got to the first place and Paul let us in. Rather than engage us or talk to us about the apartment, he just stood there in the living room with his arms crossed and left us to wander through the apartment on our own. He didn't offer any information and answered our questions with one or two word answers. Seriously, if he's that rude now, what's he going to be like when the lease gets signed? Strike one.
 
After we left the building on Walnut, the boyfriend and I walked down to S. Negley and met Paul there. He let us in and led us upstairs where he actually let a door slam right in my face. What a nice guy! And so gentlemanly! Strike Two. When we got to the second apartment, we were wandering around when I noticed a gigantic water mark with bubbling paint and all in the corner of the ceiling in one of the bedrooms with a lovely black stain that I can only assume is mold. The current tenant informed me that the roof leaked. Noooooow I know why Paul didn't want us looking at the second unit! Strike three. Kamin's out. We just turned around and walked out at that point. 


I do have to say though that Paul did us a favor by being so incredibly rude, unprofessional and overall kind of a tool. Heck maybe he hates working for Kamin and this is his way of ""sticking it to the man."" If it weren't for him, we may have believed whatever BS story a *good* salesman would have given us about how they're fixing the roof or whatnot and we may have actually bought the story and been miserable for a year. How lucky for us that Kamin has such a ""pleasant"" guy dealing with the public. It's sad though because overall the apartments would be very desirable if it weren't for Paul and the obviously leaking roof. On to greener pastures!

UzqOYLCssQS2FBcDq5HwkA,8rMME0OWVJQ2FeeHG7wUfQ,"This place used to have a great bar/tapas menu with a decent selection of happy hour wine specials.  Now...  not so much.  Well, during HH, you can get any of the wines under $10 for $5.  Selection by the glass is limited.  

As for their menu/dinner - this is totally a different story.  I haven't really been disappointed yet!  The appetizers/small plates all pretty good, I really like the chevre croquettes ($7).  The salads are good and although I haven't gotten the soup anytime lately, I hear great things from my friends.  The entrees are always excellent - I usually tend to stick to the seafood (halibut, $29) and never have been disappointed (and importantly, nothing has ever been overcooked).  The signature orecchiette dish ($20) is soooo delicious - just ignore the fact that it is a heart attack waiting to happen - it's worth it.  The desserts are ok, personally, I feel that you would be better advised to stick to filling up on the entrees.  

Oh, and let me recommend the blood orange martini if they have it - very very yummy!  And it is nice that you can order Veuve Cliquot by the glass ($16).

Prices are a bit high for what you'd expect for Pittsburgh, but considering the quality of food, I would recommend it.

P.S. I have heard that they have a great brunch on Sundays. I personally haven't tried it, but with the number of compliments I hear, it's probably worth the try!

-------------------------
Update 12/9/07:  Went to the brunch.  What a great deal!  For $22, you get a choice of alcoholic beverage (bloody mary, mimosa, bellini) as well as a starter and then the entree.  They have a lot of choices, so be prepared to just try one and come back again to try the other stuff!  The smoked salmon appetizer was good although with too much mayonnaise sauce and for me, too much onion.  The truffled potato was yummy.  The arugula salad was as delicious as ever!  And for entree, we both got the Casbah benedict.  I have to admit that neither of us was blown away, but it was good and filling.  I think that we will both be back to try other things on the menu!",0,2SwC8wqpZC4B9iFVTgYT9A,0,4,2007-07-16,review,1
TckShYnQa0eD3WQxdoE3GQ,oulyefOGLSaeYDwwWSuZZg,"Well it's official Shadyside is becoming my new favorite area for restaurants.  Damn you Big Burrito Group with your local ingredients, contemporary design and excellent service.  I was here last night and on a Monday this place was doing brisk business (definitely a good sign).  The space itself is beautiful.  You  enter from S. Highland into the outdoor dining area, which because of the heaters is viable almost every day of the year.  There is plenty of seating outdoors and a few tables indoors.  The design is contemporary.  The bar is large and has a nice area opposite for more informal seating.  The one thing I dislike about the bar area is that the ""stools"" are actually chairs that are not moveable, so your distance next to your ""neighbor"" is pre-determined.  I also prefer to stand at  the bar instead of sitting and this set up makes that more difficult.  The wine selection is pretty extensive and they have a good happy hour special that any wine or premium cocktail is just $5, which is really good when many of their wines are priced at over $10 per glass.  The hostess was very nice and professional even though she was young taking our names as we went to the bar for a drink and then anticipating our return with two menus in hand.  The server was a nice enough guy and helpful when it came time for our dinner selection.  We ordered a bottle of conundrum which is a delicious choice and I guess in line with what others charge.  We were started with an olive tepenade (sp?) and some crusty toasted thinly sliced ciabatta I think.  The tepenade was too oily and salty for me, but I guess it's what I should expect since it's ground up olives basically.  The bread was great.  It was warm really hearty bread that was wheat I think, definitely not white.  It was served with room temperature butter with some sea salt on top.  Really good start.  We then tried the smoked salmon appetizer.  I'm a huge fan of smoked salmon and was pleased with the quality of the fish, served nicely with capers and chopped egg.  It also was served with a patatoe pancake that was crisp on the outside with warm and delicious  filling.  The only thing I was a bit perplexed about was why it wasn't served with some type of bread or crouton to put the salmon on.  However, the waiter was happy to oblige by bringing out a few of the toasted ciabatta.  We also tried the lamb mac and cheese (omg was this good).  The pasta was cooked al dente' and definitely made in house.  The sauce and lamb were amazing.  This would make a fine entree' in my opinion and is total comfort food reinvented.  The only detraction I'd say is that it is a very heavy dish to serve as an appetizer on a summer menu.  Fiona had the arugula salad which was nicely prepared with pork belly (kind of like bacon), feta, and a few other interesting ingredients.  We also tried the short rib ravioli, which was incredible as well albeit a heavy dish.  By the time we got to this I think we only tried one ravioli each (plenty of leftovers).  This is such a rich dish, because shortribs are like the epitome' of richness and then to wrap them in ravioli and add cream sauce is really indulgent.  But, then again this is my chef not my cardiologist.  I tried the Elysian Fields Lamb which was cooked perfectly medium and then served with their homemade pasta wrapped around some of the lamb as well.  This was really good and the pasta was a surprise.  I actually would have preferred a green vegatable on the side instead of pasta and mashed potatoes.  The bartenders are good, especially FionaOverall, a really good place and a nice flagship of the big burrito group.",0,2SwC8wqpZC4B9iFVTgYT9A,0,4,2008-06-24,review,1

They use amazingly fresh and yummy fruits and veggies. I had the house made granola which was just amazing! Toasty and sweet, it was nothing like the granola you get out of a box. Also, while the food is totally fru-fru (in only the best way :) and it's a pricey brunch, you get a lot a food. After the great pastry basket, my appetizer, a Bellini and a cup of coffee, I had two bites of my omelette and took the rest in a doggy bag (""the rest"" included fruit salad, potatoes, and a croissant!)

My only complaint would be how long everything took. While I love a leisurely meal, an hour and a half for brunch seemed a bit excessive. I go into brunch groggy, then I have coffee and yummy food, and I'm totally amped, ready to face the day! And then I get to sit. And wait.

Scallops - Appetizer - I had high expectation but it came out a bit too over spiced.  Very rich i am glad they only gave me two.  
Fillet Mignon - Entree - Very tender piece of meat but no wear near as good as some of the places here in the Silicon Valley or even some of the chain steak places like Morton's.
Dessert - The highlight of the of the meal.  Mango panna cotta with some sorbet.  It was amazing.  The consistency of the panna cotta was perfect.  It wasn't too dense or too liquidy.

Vy6oxUFDSGCLmNA6GoA1tQ,an7_ERPIJJVWZbzsXmCs-g,"I'm not sure why this place is called Casbah.  Casbah conjures up images of genies and sand dunes or something.  Nothing about this place seems remotely middle eastern to me, other than the name.

That aside, good food and great service.  Definitely a place to impress.  I especially enjoy patronizing establishments that focus on seasonable, sustainably harvested ingredients, and although Casbah is not doing the whole ""locavore"" thing, it certainly is striving for the organic and seasonal thing.  So, off the bat, that gives it big points in my book.

We started with the calamari and the squash ravioli.  Skip the ravioli - small and kind of dried out.  But the calamari was MEATY and perfectly fried.  I actually had to stop because I was feeling ill from eating too many of them.

We all had the argula salad, which was delicious.  Quite sizeable too, given the setting.  Finally, I had the scallop and crab meat... uh... pasta dish (I have no idea what kind of pasta it was... sorry).  Which was quite good.  I actually would have preferred it over linguine, I think, but whatever.  It was deelish.

Perfect for a larger group of people.  Outside is always open and you don't really realize you are outside aside from the non-padded patio chairs and heat lamps all around.

The food is Mediterranean fusion, not exactly sure what is meant by that but it is good. The hummus here was actually the first hummus that I had ever had and I am sorry to say it is what I compare all other to, few match up.

q88CP93-o66z1c97fKLknQ,mUruu951koaIXmKeAzWYlQ,"I have been coming to Casbah for over a decade (pretty much since it first opened).  I very much like the place, and it has maintained its general character even as the head chefs have changed over the years.  Casbah is very good about continually updating its menu in an effort to stay current and relevant.  Over the years I have enjoyed many wonderful meals here including a fantastic orrechete (sp?) pasta with chicken and cranberries in a lovely cream sauce, and some of the best pork  chops (double cut)  I have ever encountered (although I no longer eat mammals, so they are likely to be the best pork chops I will ever eat).  

This is not an inexpensive place, it can be quite pricey for dinner.  One plus is that they have a very reasonable brunch on Sundays.  Their arugula salad during brunch with small diced potatoes and pancetta is fantastic.  My one complaint about the salad is that it needs a bit of acid. I always ask for a small slice of orange and then squeeze the juice onto the salad.  This cuts through the fat from the pancetta and makes the salad even more tasty.

Others may disagree, but even though this is a fairly fancy place, it is suitable for children.  Casbah has a semi outdoor seating area that is enclosed and heated even in winter.  My wife and I have often dined here with our kids.  This semi outdoor area is a bit more casual and absorbs the sounds of loud children fairly well.

QE6vmJ3_MiBZD2o6uN1ZAQ,Vovij7SfgUyj-wRvjgS7Eg,"Amazing brunch! I'd never been to Casbah before until this past Sunday when we decided to check it out for their prix-fixe menu.

For $22, you get your choice of alcoholic brunch beverage, an appetizer and an entree. An incredible price for a serious amount of great food. They had many options on their fixed menu - something for everyone. From huge waffles and omelets to lamb dishes, fish and the usual brunch regulars such as eggs benedict too. The appetizers list was equally as large. 

I started with a bloody mary. Was a nice middle ground between heavy and light - and it had some kick to it. Very good. For an appetizer I got the cheese and fruit plate with french baguette slices. There was a soft brie-like goat cheese, a blue cheese and a mild dry sheeps milk cheese as well. All were wonderful. For my entree I went with the Salmon Eggs Benedict. It was perfect. The fruit on the side was fresh cut, and the home fries were crispy on the outside, soft on the inside.

I tasted a couple of other things as well. Both the polenta and the mushroom soup on the appetizer list were great. Didn't try any of the other entrees, but everyone seemed pleased. The only complaint was from a friend that ordered the truffle omelet - and it was that he thought they went too heavy on truffle oil, drowning out the eggs. 

Also, service was absolutely perfect. We had a tall waiter, forget his name, but he was one of the most professional servers I've ever had. The table was cleared and cleaned immediately...he was never pushy, always friendly, and had great suggestions. One of the best experiences I've had for restaurant service anywhere.

I was surprised at how pricey it was before the coupons, but everything was good.

We started with two big glasses of sangria.  I thought the blueberry schnapps flavor was a little overpowering at first but it either evened out or I got used to it.

I had the risotto with morels, peas, and scallions, which was delicious.  I had never had morels before and now I understand why they're so pricey.  There was only a small handful of them on the side of the risotto, but they were delicious.  The risotto was very creamy and flavorful, the kind I wish I could make myself.  My best friend had the short rib ravioli, which she really enjoyed.  I tried the sauce and it wasn't nearly as rich as it looked.

We split a creme brulee for dessert, and the waitress very sweetly put candles in it and wrote Happy Birthday on the rim, which was a nice touch.  The creme brulee was good but definitely not the best I've ever had.  (That award may go to Soba's coffee creme brulee.)

Gotta be honest, though. Just about every time I'd been here, it's with colleagues, which means lots and lots of boozing!! Therefore, consequently, as a result, in sum, I don't have a crystal clear memory of what I had for appetizer, entree, dessert, etc. 

What I can tell you is that I had never been disappointed with anything I've ordered here. And believe you me, if the food is not that good, I will remember it no matter how drunk I am. Sure, it's not exactly a ""Mediterranean"" restaurant, but who cares? The food is great, it's in a super cute hood, the atmosphere is cozy and comfy, and the service is always spot on.

Casbah does brunch, lunch and dinner, but brunch is my favorite meal and also what they do best.  I ordered their prixe fixe brunch option which is a choice of an appetizer, brunch dish, and drink for $22.  I started off with smoked salmon and had the waitress recommended braised lamb and eggs as an entree and a mimosa to drink.  My companion ordered butternut squash & apple cider soup, wild mushroom omelet, and a glass of fresh orange juice.

While waiting for our food, we munched on their complimentary pastry basket consisting of super moist mini-muffins, scones, and super rich and buttery biscuits with honey butter.

The smoked salmon came with capers, minced red onion, crumbled egg, a drizzle of aioli, and a beautiful fried potato cake.  There was just the perfect amount of everything on the dish; the potato cake was just big enough to balance out the saltiness of the smoked salmon and the capers of course paired beautifully with the smoked salmon.  I tried some of the butternut squash & apple cider soup and it had some a pretty complex flavor.

My entree reminded me of an eggs benedict with a twist: grilled  sourdough topped with spinach, braised lamb shoulder and two poached eggs.  I love braised meats because braising can do such wonders to tougher cuts.  The braised lamb shoulder was flavorful, tender, and super rich.  The best part about poached eggs is sopping up the extra yolk with bread and it just tasted better with the sauce of the lamb soaking into the sourdough to soften it up a bit.  This dish itself is enough to make me a regular.  I tried my companion's home fries which came with this slightly spicy ketchup (I think it's house-made) and also a piece of her omelet which was pretty good too.

Service was good, ambiance was good, portions were big, quality was excellent, AND they take reservations.  Sometimes I don't mind waiting the half hour it takes to get seats at some restaurants (Point Brugge, Coca Cafe, etc.), but most times I'd rather spend time with people in the restaurant at a table rather than waiting outside, especially now with winter approaching.",0,2SwC8wqpZC4B9iFVTgYT9A,0,5,2009-11-01,review,4

88eJe5ywmYrrM_IyPyx8kw,quxxNt2i8R79fZB0_6aOug,"Out of the Big Burrito group (not counting mad mex) this is probably the biggest disappoint of their chain. And this is just not a one time bad experience, I have been here three times and have been less than enthused with the food vs price/value.

Service has always been good and attentive I enjoy their wines and the selections but on almost every dish there is something is either wrongly out of place or I expected much better for the money I am paying. For example:

Sumac scallop Appetizer, cooked perfectly, but the tartness of the sumac was not there, the other thing is I can brown a scallop at home, in a restaurant I am looking for a perfectly cooked scallop that has a nice caramelized sear on it, almost crunchy top juicy center. Also why so stingy with the baba ghanoush, 1 tsp, come on, eggplant is that expensive.

Risotto - Over cooked not even a little bit of toothiness to the grain, plus it was pretty devoid of flavor but seemed to have had the addition of cream and butter to make it creamy.

Duck Entrée, again duck was perfectly cooked, quince jus was nice, not overly sweet but the faro did not compliment the dish at all. I even had a dining companion taste the combination and asked if they like it and they said it didn't go.

Pasta entrée with spinach, this could have been good, but spinach was not washed and had grit in it, this item was returned and a braised lamb dish was ordered in its place, the lamb was slightly undercooked (read just a little tough) and jus that went with it was very watery.

If this was some little bistro where I was paying $20-25 for dinner (no drinks) I wouldn't be so picky but some of my meals have been north of $40 and for that amount of money I expect a little more attention to detail.",1,2SwC8wqpZC4B9iFVTgYT9A,1,3,2009-12-28,review,1
DX_byrz0UkiaGDHjDK46jQ,14dt6dtqwD2dqu5Ycw7ybA,"I'm a big fan of all the Big Burrito restaurants I've tried (Eleven, Umi, Mad Mex & Casbah). I think Eleven is my favorite, but Casbah is a very close second. 

My most recent trip was with my wife on 1/15/10. We started with the grilled flat bread and the butternut squash ravioli. For entrees, I had the Casbah twice cut pork chop and my wife had a pasta dish with sausage and ricotta. For dessert, I had the creme brulee and my wife had the espresso ice cream / cookie (it was really just a fancy chipwich). 

The grilled flat bread came with three different dips, Humus, Red Pepper Hummus, and Baba Ganoush. I really enjoyed all three, but thought the Red Pepper Hummus stood out as the best, although if you're not a fan of garlic you may disagree. The butternut squash ravioli didn't impress me much, but my wife really liked it. 

As far as the entrees, we both really enjoyed our meals. My pork chop was cooked perfectly, and was anything but dry. The sage aioli that it was topped with added an excellent flavor. The sides were kale, and butternut squash risotto, both of which really shined. I can't describe how amazing the risotto was, and the kale was extremely flavorful. 

I tried my wife's pasta dish, and overall I thought it was good, but the sausage was really outstanding. Incredibly tender and flavorful. 

Neither of us were too impressed with our desserts. The creme brulee was very good, but at that point, I expected it to be great. My wife's dessert sort of disappointed, since the cookies were dry. 

The bill for everything listed above, plus a bottle of red wine (~$35) was $120 before tip, so it is pricey, but in my opinion totally worth it. 

Also, our server was very attentive and helpful, without being intrusive. I asked his opinion on the French Malbec and he gave me his honest opinion, which was negative.",1,2SwC8wqpZC4B9iFVTgYT9A,0,5,2010-01-17,review,2
dtd-wIGTJl7QVWpCA-3_Cw,fHYx0Qtt4SKIhoyu3Bv4_g,"One of my favorite restaurants in the world.  

Excellent atmosphere, fantastic food, great wine/drinks.  Menu changes up pretty regularly and I've never had a bad dish there.  The stuffed pork loin was one of my favorites.  Also they usually have a summer sangria (even in winter :) that is delicious. The scallops were also fantastic. The front patio/tent is open year round with heat lamps.

Revision: 

I was just back at Casbah for a fundraising dinner.  Once a month they do a private dinner for a charity - for $100 there is a five course meal with wine flights.  All proceeds (not just the profits) go to the charity.

My dinner was so good, I literally almost cried.  The wild mushroom risotto was bar far one of the the best things I've ever eaten in my life.  Short rib ravioli was my 3rd favorite thing I ate that evening, but I found myself dreaming of it the next morning!  I had low expectations for dessert - it was a cornbread cake (weird!) but came with a blueberry compote and cream cheese ice cream.  The cornbread cake was an excellent balance between the sweetness of the ice cream and blue berries.  It was amazing!

While I don't believe these are regular menu items, I highlight this because this was their charity dinner.  That they made NO money off of.  An area where they could skim on quality - but no - it was amazing.  Reaffirmed my belief that this is the best restaurant in Pittsburgh.",0,2SwC8wqpZC4B9iFVTgYT9A,0,5,2010-01-17,review,0
UyvhshDZ5VWfOWhh_GWsYw,oYjynxN12NFuKOeyYII1Hw,"Part of the same restaurant group as Eleven, which I have eaten at and reviewed here, Casbah is a vibrant restaurant in Pittsburgh's Shadyside district.

While the menu changes daily, there are several mainstays available on most evenings.  One of them, the pork chop, is one of the finest I have ever had.  Double cut, juicy and flavorful, it is an absolute winner.  Braised kale and butternut squash risotto accompany this perfect dish.

I managed to sample two other dishes (courtesy of my willing dinner mates) that are also noteworthy.  The short rib ravioli is an excellent combination of tender, richly flavored beef rib and toothy pasta.  The ricotta cavatelli combines fresh, simple ingredients into a well structured dish.

Service was a little hit or miss the evening I was there.  Part of that may be because we were a large group and the restaurant was rather busy.  However, for an establishment of this caliber, I do expect more.  Nevertheless, I plan on trying Casbah again on my next trip to Pittsburgh.",0,2SwC8wqpZC4B9iFVTgYT9A,0,4,2010-02-14,review,0

We opted for an inside table, the interior is somewhat small the tables are close together.  For brunch, you are served your choice of drink, appetizer and entree.  

For our drinks, BJ had a Bloody Mary and I had a Bellini.  We were served a basket of yummie bread and mini muffins.  For appetizers, we got a Three Sisters Farms mesclun greens and smoked salmon and truffled potato cake.  Very good.  For entrees we selected a jumbo lump crab & tomato omelet and the NY strip steak.

4cW3iQW6JD1C8VxYP0eyXg,rGA5i9HvBuBAVkLZ4eafDg,"I was determined to let this one pass (experience was not worth commentary) until I made a disturbing discovery...

I made a reservation for inside. They sat us outside. That turned out to be preferable to us because the tables that WERE available inside were very close to others. The patio was spacious and decorated with busts, slightly preferable to the inner cheap.trendy.interiors.com shit. Have you seen the terrible bathroom wallpaper borders? Probably not, as the ladies room is a very dim place; don't expect to be able to notice that your botox implant is crooked. Anyway, It was HOT under the Space-Ray heater on the patio, making for a sweaty and ice-instantly-melted beverage winter night. The food was alright with some interesting flavor pairings, but it was certainly not quite worth the price. The bread was the best I've had in Pittsburgh. Our server made it seem that everything she was doing was somebody else's job, in fact, it was mostly other people who delivered, which made it confusing in terms of knowing who to ask for things and whether or not to factor some of the fine service into the tip that presumably goes mostly to the primary server who was sub-par for upscale dining; our question for the kitchen left unanswered, ""the host is supposed to do that but I will..."" Run on. When I described the qualities I was looking for in my wine choice during beverage inquiry, she just stared blankly and waited for me to decide. The wine list did not include descriptions. The gal who delivered the wine thankfully did describe it before popping the top and it was determined that I did not want this cheapest option before me! She described another bubbly that sounded and was, according to my own tastes, delightful. 

I was so very satisfied with the sparkling sensation of the meal that I sought it out at the Wine and Spirits store. This was the moment that my minor disappointment in the value of my special-occasion dinner at Casbah turned into a feeling of devastating violation. I am talking about a 400% markup on the retail price of this wine. If you want to do your own math: at Casbah the 1/2 bottle of Gruet Blanc Du Noirs cost $35, while a WHOLE bottle at W&S is priced at $16.99. You can bet that I will choose to enjoy this wine elsewhere, like Avenue B (byob), next time. 

Casbah is lacking the quality service, honesty and original ambiance that should accompany creative food at moderately high prices.

**Update: I recently saw a full size bottle of the Gruet on a restaurant menu for $30; Casbah, take a tip!",0,2SwC8wqpZC4B9iFVTgYT9A,1,2,2010-03-03,review,2

DcQobAk5lNJw6pVI4nVN1Q,vL8JhCIH9rTYTq8iIlyKHw,"My boyfriend took me to Casbah for my birthday this March. This is one of our twice-a-year splurges and I have been wanted to go to this restaurant for ages.
We were seated outside, in the covered, heated patio. We were far enough away from the heaters that we didn't get too hot, and far enough from the doors that we didn't get too cold. The menu has changed slightly since we dined there, but some of the things have stayed the same.
We started with the sheep's milk gnudi, which is like ravioli without the pasta. I have a gluten allergy and I have missed ravioli quite a bit, so I was happy to eat this. The flavor of the sheep's milk is quite strong and unique, which I like. 
For entree, I had the double-cut pork chop. This was absolutely great - the flavors and textures of the pork, butternut squash risotto, braised kale, garlic cream, and sage jus went really well together. It was an enormous portion, as well - I took some home and ate it the next day!
My boyfriend had the seared rare tuna. He was less thrilled with his dish, and when I tasted it, I agreed. I normally LOVE seared tuna but this was not the best treatment of it. It tasted a little too ""fishy"" and I didn't think the other flavors complimented the tuna. 
Instead of dessert, we sampled two dessert wines recommended to us by the server. I do think that $10 is a little much to charge for such a small glass of wine, but I guess that's what you have to expect when you dine at this level.
We are great fans of the Big Burrito restaurants, and I think we preferred our experience at Soba to Casbah. While our food was really good, the prices were a little unreasonably high. And I wouldn't recommend the seared tuna!",1,2SwC8wqpZC4B9iFVTgYT9A,0,4,2010-04-11,review,1

For my 2 courses I got the cinnamon polenta which is basically like oatmeal but much more creamier. IT was honestly, amazing. I loved it. It came with some almonds and some cranberries, but the polenta itself was great. I would come back just to have that for breakfast. For the main dish i got a crab omelette. It came with fresh fruit and potato fingerlings. The potatoes were great and the omelette was ok. Not the best I have had, but any place with crab in an omelette should get credit.

It was a great brunch and i was stuffed by the end. This place was courteous and the waitress was attentive but not overbearing. We had a great time here and it's just a nice place to relax.",0,2SwC8wqpZC4B9iFVTgYT9A,0,4,2010-06-24,review,0
5lq4LkrviYgQ4LJNsBYHcA,7GAcFg4nSnf0OqeAXRxekw,"For our last lunch in Pittsburgh we decided to return to the Big Burrito Group; Eleven was quite good and both Gayot and Pittsburgh Magazine compared the experience at Casbah favorably to that of Big Burrito's crown jewel.  Citing a mix of Mediterranean and Northern African influences with a bargain Piccola Gusto Menu for lunch and the option for indoor or al fresco dining it seemed as if Casbah was a can't miss option...well, sometimes things don't turn out quite as you expect - almost everything that transpired from the moment we arrived until the moment we left was a failure.

When our server, a young woman named Amanda L who would prove quite inept and inefficient from start to finish, finally did arrive our menus were delivered with a brief hello before she wandered away - another server later stopped by to fill our water and drinks were never even offered.  When Amanda finally did return she was capable of answering a couple questions about portion size and our orders were placed.  With my mom and sister opting for the two-course Gusto lunch and myself choosing two courses a la carte we sat and sipped our water.

Waiting approximately 10 minutes another ancillary server arrived with bread and butter - a light and airy white bread with a hefty crust paired with a sweet and salted cow's milk butter - decent, but nothing to write home about compared to the myriad bread options at Eleven.  After this point we would not see another staff member for 30 minutes...well, we would see them, they just wouldn't be walking anywhere near our table - instead bussing tables and running around while the hostess flirted with a man at the bar...I'll note that my water glass remained empty for greater than 15 minutes.

Finished with our first courses approximately 10 minutes would pass - long enough for me to actively collect each and every plate and stack them at the empty seat of our four-top - before Amanda would finally return to collect the dirty plates...we'd not see her again until 15 minutes later when she filled our water glasses and told us our main courses would be ""right out.""  While I guess she didn't define ""right out,"" what this actually meant was ""in 25 minutes.""  Starting first with my mother's combo - Jumbo Lump Crab, pepper bacon, avocado, radish sprouts, on a paesano bun and Orecchiette Pasta with grilled chicken, dried cranberries, Riverview Farms goat cheese, sage cream. While the sandwich may not be memorable, the pasta was actually quite impressive.  Using a less salty cheese and mild cream to flavor the al dente little ears of pasta worked wonders while the sweet/savory mélange of craisins and grilled chicken were a nice match.

Vastly less well done than my mother's plate would be my sister's option - the Grilled Vegetables, portobello, zucchini, eggplant, arugula, chickpea hummus, on baguette and Maccheretto pasta with wild mushrooms, white beans, sun-dried tomatoes, rapini pesto, fontina, walnuts.  Beginning with the sandwich, the bite I had was good in taste but rather mushy in consistency - too many similar vegetable textures and the hummus spread too thickly.  Moving on to the pasta - we all tasted it, but I'm still not sure what we were supposed to be tasting - it tasted like watery cheese...no spice, no salt, and certainly nothing resembling pesto or tomatoes.  For the first time in the meal Amanda actually opted to check on us approximately 10 minutes into our main courses and when told of the watery pasta she did apologize and offered to replace it with something else - more Orcchiette.

For my main course I received a simple side salad-fresh greens, crispy onion strings, and a pleasant vinaigrette.  The salad, of course, was served alongside Elysian Fields Lamb ""Mac and Cheese"", tubetti pasta, mascarpone, cheddar, Pecorino-Romano, and bread crumbs.  Piping hot and browned with crispy bread crumbs the dish was a decent Macaroni and Cheese, but honestly the lamb was so scarce and thinly cut that it added little.

Completing our mains approximately 110 minutes after entering Casbah we again waited nearly ten minutes before anyone would stop by to collect dirty plates-a different ancillary server this time.  With my mother and sister already deciding enough was enough they stood up to use the restroom before leaving-by the time Amanda would stop by to ask if anyone would care for dessert our two course meal had lasted 2:05 and I skipped on a menu entailing bread pudding, carrot cake, and panna cotta with ""just the bill.""

Settling the bill via credit card no tip was left because no tip was deserved - in reality Amanda may have actually be the worst server I've encountered at a fine dining establishment in the last 2 years.  I will note that when I wrote to Big Burrito was met by a (seemingly) sincere apology without excuses - the Manager stated things don't' normally happen like that and he'd be sure the issue was addressed.

I had a wine flight (they have a good wine selection), and several appetizers, soups and salad.  Everything was delicious, especially the complimentary bread and they olive oil-based stuff you can put on it.  Most of the ingredients come from local farms and food suppliers, and I really liked they even gave them credit on the menu, the first time I have ever seen that in a restaurant (shouldn't they deserve at least as much credit as the chef? After all, they spend months growing the stuff chefs spend maybe seconds using).

The atmosphere is really cool, I recommend sitting out on the patio in summer.  The only negative things I can say about Casbah is the high price for relatively little food and the misleading name (I expected more of a Middle Eastern menu and vibe).",0,2SwC8wqpZC4B9iFVTgYT9A,0,4,2010-07-25,review,0

hYaLWF-gCxMMsTEMTMw-sQ,ROzdcg98T9ajnrYNUZtj7w,"I had lunch here on a hot Saturday, so we skipped the outdoor seating in the front and opted for the air-conditioned interior. 

The sweet corn fondue appetizer was a definite highlight of the lunch.  I had thought that the cheese might drown out the flavor of the corn, but both flavors held their own very well.  The chanterelle mushroom and goat cheese omelet I had as my entree was okay but not outstanding.  I did, however, enjoy the mesclun salad that came with the omelet, especially the vinaigrette and fried shallot slices.  Dessert was a semolina cake with macerated fresh peaches and cream cheese ice cream (think cheesecake flavored).  The bookends of my meal were so delicious that I wasn't all that disappointed by the middle portion of it.

While I can't afford Casbah on a regular basis as a grad student, the prices aren't exorbitant.  There's even a lunch special for $14, which gives you two courses: either a salad or cup of soup, and your choice of a pasta, risotto, or half a sandwich.  I didn't choose this option, but it seems like a reasonably-priced way to sample several things on the menu.

Our server was very professional, and checked on us after every course (the appetizer, entrees and dessert).  I'll definitely keep Casbah in mind for special occasions in the future.  It's classy without being pretentious or stuffy.",0,2SwC8wqpZC4B9iFVTgYT9A,0,4,2010-08-26,review,2

I got a free entree coupon for my birthday, for signing up for Big Burrito's mailing list, and decided to revisit Casbah.  The good: we got to enjoy the patio even though the weather was a little cool because it was heated.  My maccheretto, a pasta entree with white beans, sun-dried tomato, pesto and walnuts, was very good.  The pasta was al dente and the white beans were perfectly cooked (not mushy).  It was maybe a touch too salty (the fontina, maybe?), but I was happy with the choice.  

Now, onto the weird.  After taking our orders, our waiter asked if we wanted bread with our big-calorie pasta dishes.  Checking if we want bread is fine--but, umm, he could have left out the comment about the pasta?  My friend and I are both twentysomething women.  Luckily, we're not that insecure about our bodies.  We like to eat.  Yes, bring the bread.

When he brought our entrees, he sang ""Happy birthday to you, happy birthday to you"" under his breath as he put my pasta in front of me.  I don't like people singing to me at restaurants, so I'm grateful it wasn't audible to everyone else on the patio--but a simple ""Happy birthday"" would have sufficed.  Then when he cleared our plates, he asked if my dish was ""everything [I] wanted, and more.""  I appreciate the gestures, but it felt artificial.

He asked if we'd like to see the dessert menu--and added that he was supposed to ask that, that we shouldn't feel obligated.  Uh, what?  I think this and the bread/pasta comment bothered me the most.  

To redeem the birthday coupon, you have to show an ID.  I recently cut my hair, so it's different than my license photo.  When he returned my ID to me, our waiter said, ""I like the short hair.""  If this had been the only unusual statement he had made during the meal, I would have taken it as a compliment.  I guess it is one.  But when considered with all the other weird things, it just felt like he was trying way too hard and my friend and I both felt awkward.

The covered patio was perfect for a Friday evening in late August--it was pouring outside and we stayed dry.  The service was so-so, which I'm docking a star for.  The server was attentive, but she was a little slow.  She also spilled the apple icewine on two of us while bringing out deserts and we were charged for those drinks.

yfRrC6MhxpIJ4-xMcrmk5Q,39XuVN28H0eMmdvWHXaMTw,"I've been here twice now, once for drinks and once for dinner, and I'd have to say that generally, I'm a fan.  Their happy hour has some good deals - $6 cocktails and glasses of wine, and $1 of bottled beer.  It was a fun, trendy atmosphere and a nice place to go for a glass of sangria after a busy day.

I came back for dinner a month or so later.  We had reservations (on a Monday night) and were seated immediately -even though the restaurant was surprisingly busy.  We sat in the covered area out front - sort of like sitting in a dim, Mediterranean garden.  And yes - the lights are low throughout the whole restaurant.  Even with my young eyes, I still needed a candle to read the menu.  But it is romantic and a peaceful place to eat.  A little uncomfortable, as they have metal chairs (sort of like upscale patio furniture), but not a big deal.  Sit inside at a booth if you need to sit on something soft.

The menu is pricey and we're all poor, so we just got entrees.  I actually had a cocktail to start - the Perfect Pear - with elderflower liqueur, vodka, sage, pear, and vermouth.  There was even a little sage leaf floating in the glass.  It was a wonderful drink, with all the flavors I love.  Still, for the price, I think the portion was a little stingy.  When I buy an $11 cocktail, I like it to really fill the glass.  We nibbled on warm bread while we waited, and all tried their pesto on top - I think it was an unusual homemade pesto, something like walnut-watercress?  It was a bit bland - I think regular basil pesto would've been a better choice.

Things got better during the actual dinner.  I ordered the Heritage Farms Chicken which was juicy and fresh, and served with a tangy pasta.  Each little detail of the dish was well-chosen - honestly, even the grilled baby squash was outstanding.  It's just squash!  But somehow, it was heavenly.  My friend enjoyed her Cioppino, and my boyfriend liked his veal tortellini, complete with rich pieces of lobster.  I tried a little bit, and it was tasty - very herbal and really bursting with flavor.  The only dish that fell a little flat was the potato gnocchi - my friend's boyfriend ordered it.  Actually he liked most of it very much, but he couldn't get past the aggressive bitterness of the turnip greens.  I tasted them too, and I have to say - it was off-putting.  Perhaps that's just the way turnip greens are, but it really didn't work for us in the dish.  Fortunately, the waitress was incredibly kind and helpful, and brought him out a new plate sans greens, which he finished happily.

We also had a few desserts - vanilla bean creme brulee for us, flourless chocolate torte for them.  I didn't taste it, but apparently it was incredibly rich.  I enjoyed our creme brulee - because I enjoy all creme brulee - although the roasted quince on top didn't quite work for me.  

Overall, the meal ranged between good and very good, but the great service from our waitress really pushed this to a 4 star rating.  I had hoped to be a little more wowed by the food.  But this experience was definitely positive enough to warrant a second visit for dinner.

You can select a drink (alcoholic or non), an appetizer, and a brunch entree for the price of $22. The appetizers we had (pollenta and squash&chestnut soup) were very good. The entrees, on the other hand, left a lot to be desired. We got the mushroom omelet and jumbo lump crab and tomato omelet. The omelet was very bland. It did not have much flavor and needed seasoning and more ingredients than just eggs. Basically, I have had better omelets at some Denny's. My drink mimosa was just OK. My girlfriend's blood mary was delicious, though -- uniquely spicy. 

I have been to Casbah 4 times, last time being for brunch today. The first time, it was good, worthy of 4 stars. It gradually went down to 3 stars. The wine selection is good. But the food is definitely hit or miss. Once I had a halibut that smelled like the ocean. It was not well cooked or fresh, or something.

U0KN9jRenZIyTkdYNH2yKg,gkOBdPFir636v8AZr2riOQ,"Last night was the first time that we had been to Casbah in a long time - we used to absolutely love it, but a couple of disappointing brunch and dinner experiences had put us off of it. However, we decided to give it another chance, and I am glad that we did. 

Even though we had a reservation, we were seated (without them asking us our preference) in the front area, but that was fine, since the heaters kept it toasty warm. It was also a great table thanks to our terrific waitress. Wow, was she cheerful and friendly! She was also helpful with making recommendations - when I asked her about the cocktails, she pointed out the relatively new ""Beet and Potato,"" which had beet-infused vodka as one of the main ingredients. It was a cool cocktail - an interesting blend of savory and sweet, and very seasonally appropriate. I don't know if I would order it again, but I'm very glad I had it once.

For dinner, I ended up having a soup and then an appetizer, since I wasn't too hungry. The caramelized onion soup was so warming - it was like an update of the classic french onion soup. The broth was not too salty (a common problem with onion soups), and the onions had been braised perfectly. Everything was just the right texture as the onions, broth, and ""crouton"" blended together.

I ordered the sheep's milk gnudi for my main course. Even though it came in an appetizer-sized portion, it was still a lot of food, since the gnudi are so filling. The gnudi were nicely molten in the middle, and just the right softness on the outside. There were a variety of accompaniments to the gnudi, but the standouts were the brussel sprouts. I'm actually not a huge fan of sprouts, but I ate every one in the dish. They were light and buttery, solid but not rock-hard, and had just a trace amount of bitterness left. That is how sprouts should taste!

Even though I didn't plan on ordering dessert, I ended up getting the warm walnut baklava with cinnamon ice cream. The warmth of the baklava melted the ice cream nicely, and the flavors just blended together on the plate. The baklava was quite traditional in its assembly and spice blend, but the extra cinnamon with cream gave the whole dessert just a bit of extra oomph.

In summary, I'm glad that we gave Casbah another try. I wish that they would go back to offering all of their pastas in both entree and appetizer sizes, and I miss the crazy variety of wine flights that they used to have (it seems like they just have 4 now), but it's still a great dinner destination.",0,2SwC8wqpZC4B9iFVTgYT9A,0,4,2011-02-04,review,2

My bf and I went for JUST dessert and wine, which we told the hostess ahead of time. The waitress was very curt and disrespectful. We were rushed to order (even though there were plenty of empty tables and it was NOT closing time). She did not offer suggestions or advice.

We ended up ordering the flourless chocolate cake. The cake was extremely rich (but delicious!) and the portion was just right for sharing after dinner. The marscapone was silky and paired perfectly with the cherries on top.

The waitress kept coming back to see if we were done and ready for our check. After we got the check, she was in a hurry to get us out the door.

The previous reviewer who said the Bloody Mary is the best drink was spot-on. It had a great spice and was the only drink that seemed like it had any alcohol in it at all. The mimosa and sangria were very ""eh."" 

I loved my smoked salmon appetizer (and that did seem to be the hit at the table), but entrees around the table left people disappointed. The goat cheese and mushroom omelette could have had a heckuva lot more goat cheese and mushrooms, and my scallop/sausage/grits/egg dish just had way too much going on. The grits were actually fabulous, but the scallops were overcooked and got lost next to the scrambled eggs (?) and sage sausage crumbles.

Everything was ok to start and the mains were all good, although they rely heavily on butter and huge portions for their mainstay of flavor and satisfaction.

We booked our reservation on OpenTable, which I was glad to see that they actually used. I noted that both of us diners were vegetarian and found that our server and hostess were very accommodating in that respect.

We were seated outside, which offered us a pleasant experience on their lovely patio. Their ambiance is nice and their service outstanding. I found that everyone there knew what they were talking about and possessed a deep passion for food, as opposed to obnoxious pretense which upscale restaurants like Casbah can have.

As for the food, it was above average. Nothing outstanding, but definitely still tasty. My boyfriend ordered the gnocchi (made veg), which turned out to be excellent, while I got the cavatelli (also made veg). We also shared a half-order of the torchetti and unfortunately, neither the cavatelli nor the torchetti stood out too much. The gnocchi and the appetizer (grilled chickpea flatbread) were by far the highlights.

The perfect blend of sweet (fresh tomato sauce) and spicy -- the meatballs had a nice tang, and the polenta was delicious albeit there wasn't much of it there.  We each then had the heirloom tomato salad which was tasteless.  I grow heirlooms and know the intense and wonderful flavor they should have. These tasted like a grocery store tomato bought in December.  Very disappointing.  I opted for the cavatelli entree which was not prepared as described on the menu.  It was swimming in tomato sauce and overall was very bland.  Another disappointment.  My husband had the pork chop which wasn't bad but certainly didn't leave us wanting to return here for the food.  All this said, the service was professional, we enjoyed the drinks (he had the sangria and I their house cosmopolitan) and had a lovely bottle of wine.

I ordered the smoked salmon for the appetizer and the mushroom omlette for my entree, and had a hot coffee (they did not have ice coffee though offered to put ice with hot coffee if I wanted it). The waitress brought out some delicious mini baked treats before we got our dishes - poppy scone (on the crispier side but delicious), blueberry muffins and biscuits, which were all buttery goodness.

The restaurant is really cool looking but I was a little confused by the bar set up.  We sat at the bar because they didn't have any tables open.  I usually don't mind sitting at the bar but the stools are bolted to the floor, and about 2 feet from each other.  If you have three people with you, forget about mingling!  

Also, the service was very iffy.  There was a bartender, and then a server for the bar area (or what it seemed like).  The bartender got us our drinks, but never told us a server would be with us.  I figured she was our server too.  But then some other woman came up to us all flustered.  She never introduced herself, just asked what we wanted and kept saying ""okay, okay, okay.""  Just very odd.  It continued that way the entire time.

I tried the prix fixed brunch for $24, which includes your choice of an alcoholic bevvie (Bloody Mary, Sangria or Mimosa), appetizer and main course.  I had the mimosa, that was the perfect mix (splash of OJ:), Polenta and Eggs Beni.  The cinnamon polenta, which was delish: light, fluffy and warm with dried fruit and almonds on top.  I loved it!

The Eggs Beni with smoked salmon.  It was just okay.  I kept trying to think pf what was missing and I believe it was that the hollandaise sauce had no real taste.  I expect hollandaise sauce to be rich and creamy, this was thin and blah.

Casbah's brunch is a prix fixe...which at first seems expensive, but when you realize the amount of food you're getting, it's sooo not. You get an appetizer, entree, and drink (yes, a real drink, with alcohol) for just $24. I usually end up spending more at my other Big Burrito brunch spot, Kaya, so I consider this a pretty good deal.

They start you off with a basket of muffins and biscuits with honey butter on the side. And it's refillable. Try to restrain yourself from eating too many baked goods though, so you can get to the real food. For appetizers, everything I've had was pretty good (polenta and the salads have been my faves), but for the entree, there is only ONE thing you should order: The lamb & eggs!  Crusty sourdough bread topped with spinach topped with braised lamb shoulder and roasted garlic, topped with poached eggs. One of the best things I have ever eaten in the morning. The scallop scramble is just okay, the steak & eggs are pretty delish...but the lamb & eggs is by far the best thing on the brunch menu.

This is one of the few places where I don't opt for the Bloody Mary...it's pretty blah. I do their Salty Dog with freshly squeezed grapefruit juice, or sometimes get it sans alcohol if I'm really feeling the pain from Saturday night.

Unfortunately, while I love the atmosphere, I feel like the service is lacking.

Boy and I went to Casbah on a warm Tuesday evening. The restaurant wasn't busy, and we were seated in the inviting outdoor patio. Our waitress was very pleasant and extremely informative about both the drink and food menus. 

We shared a bottle of Mission la Caminade (Malbec, French). This was a very good, medium-bodied wine. 

Many yelpers have raved about Casbah's bread and pesto. I don't get it. I've had much better sourdough elsewhere and the pesto wasn't anything to write home about. 

I had the asparagus soup with crab for an appetizer.  The soup was served cold and tasted fresh enough, but something was off, and I barely ate half of it. 

I ordered the orecchiette pasta as an entree, which was served with grilled chicken and cranberries in a goat cheese cream sauce. I am upset to report that this tasted rather bland. The cranberries were the only spark of flavor in the dish.  Boy ordered the ricotta cavatelli pasta, which was in a marinara sauce with sausage and ricotta. I am sad to report that this too was tasteless. The ricotta was dumped on top and added nothing to the dish. 

We glanced at the dessert menu, after spending so much on food we didn't enjoy, boy and I decided to cross the street for ice cream, instead.

Overall, we were all left with kind of a ""meh"" experience.  Our server seemed pretty disinterested and slow.  I think the low point was someone ordered a steak medium rare (for $38).  What came out was a well done and COLD piece of meat.  It looked like a hockey puck. 

When he sent it back, no apology...and no change in the bill.  I at least expected a manager or someone to come out and apologize and say ""We've taken it off the bill"" or SOMETHING.  Nope.  He sat there watching the rest of us finish our entrees before his replacement steak arrived.

The rest of the entrees were good and I would go back.  But probably with lowered expectations.",2,2SwC8wqpZC4B9iFVTgYT9A,1,3,2012-05-13,review,2

Food: 
- Cracked pepper butter was delicious - I had to warn the waitress not to let me have any more bread and ruin my meal!
- Grilled Bruschetta (ricotta, fava beans, Swiss chard,  preserved lemon, arugula, chervil, Calcagno) was a bit too lemon-y for my liking
- Short Rib Raviolli (Short Rib Ravioli, Swiss chard, oyster mushrooms, roasted shallots, gremolata) was very savory and I would definitely order it again
- Double-Cut Pork Chop (with braised kale, prosciutto & parmesan risotto, garlic cream, sage jus) was Joe's meal. I tasted a bit of everything and really enjoyed the kale. I like really really creamy risotto, and this wasn't quite there. I dont want to say it was undercooked, as I like I just like mine over-cooked.
- Fried Apple Empanadas (vanilla bean cider reduction, toasted oat streusel,  
caramel ice cream) The ice cream was great, but the empanadas were bland to me.

Service: Not terrible. I understand at nice restaurants people enjoy taking their time to relax, enjoy their meals, and converse with their dinner-mates, but our server should have been more observant to the fact that we would be just sitting there with empty places waiting for the desert menu. I will note, though, that the table next to us returned two glasses of the same wine and the bartender came over and very politely suggested an alternative wine for the patron. They were very accommodating in this way.

tAKjY3bQXH51msJbOHYPmQ,qnQoXQ5l3GkY_iFx-mO9PA,"I was treated to Casbah for lunch by a potential employer who had passed me over, but really, really liked me. She said it was her favorite restaurant, but that she didn't go as often as she'd like.

I knew the building from the early 80's when it had been one of Pittsburgh's dive gay bars called 'The Tender Trap', and knowing this, as well as a lot about the Big Bistroid Group...oops...Big BURRITO Group, I was curious to try it out and see if it lived up to the usual Big Burrito hype.  And voila, indeed, it's another excruciatingly overpriced bistroid in da burgh.

The atmosphere is actually quite lovely, inside or out. The colors are comfortable, the noise levels subtle, the seating comfortable, and the service staff looks professional (YOUNG) with no Coney Island side show appearances.

The service was good. Not overly friendly, but not uppity like young people waiting tables in more upscale restaurants tend to be in da bugh.

The menu was short, but did have a list of pretty unique offerings.  My friend had a salmon salad, and I opted to try the Farm Lamb Mac-n-Cheese.  The waiter brought a small basket with bread to the table accompanied by a single medium sized pat of salted butter to spread.  For a beverage, we both opted for just water.

I have to say, if I actually had to pay for this, I would have been pretty miffed.  

For LUNCH, the prices were all around the $15 range, and the portions were NOT large.  The portions were actually fine for lunch, not overly filling (by any stretch of the imagination), but they didn't leave you hungry.

I can't speak for the salmon, as I have NEVER had salmon in any form other than lox that didn't taste like a dried sawdust version of some strong fish. She seemed to enjoy it very much, so there it is.

The Farm Lamb mac n cheese was tasty. The lamb was tender and moist, and the mac n cheese was a tiny tube pasta with a very nice creamy cheesy sauce, all topped with a bread crumb covering when it was broiled until crispy.  It was accompanied by a 'pinch' of mesclun salad topped with another pinch of fried onions.

Basically - take one large spoonful of mac n cheese with a higher end cheese sauce and a fancier noodle than comes in the average box - mix in about four cubes of roast lamb, sprinkle on a layer of bread crumbs and toss it in the broiler until the crumbs are toasted - then using your index finger and thumb, pick up a pinch of mesclun and sit it on the plate next to the mac n cheese bowl - and you have a bistroid expensive art project on a plate.

Seriously? $15 for lunch? It's mac n cheese people!

I also have to call into question the name and theme.  Mad Mex is bistroid Tex Mex.  Soba is bistroid Asian.  Kaya is bistroid Caribbean-ish.  Casbah? Farm Lamb mac n cheese? Sure, I can see this as a box lunch while riding a camel through the desert...not.

I can't say the experience was awful. The company was awesome, and we had a nice unpressured amount of time for fun chat.  The atmosphere was comfortable, and the food was tasty.  But was it all worthy of a return trip or recommendation?  I honestly can't say 'yes' with any kind of cheerleader rave.  

I'm not quite sure that I comprehend the mindset of people in this burgh who think paying that kind of money for food is worth it, when honestly, food with just as much flavor can be found in abundance around town for half the price and twice the portion. 

Who are all of these easily dupe-able rich people, and where do they come from? Want to blow that kind of money? Get out your check book and let me give you my address!",0,2SwC8wqpZC4B9iFVTgYT9A,0,3,2012-07-21,review,3

As we usually do, we decided to share our entrees (TIP - you can get half portion sizes of the pastas!!) and augment the meal with a few appetizers.  For the appetizers, we got the chickpea flatbread, the arugula salad and the sea scallops.  The flatbread and salad were just OK.  The sea scallops would have been delicious except for the ""cured egg yolk"" which was infused in the avacado sauce.  For those who have never tried a cured egg yolk, I would consider yourself lucky.  Actually, the taste wasn't too bad.  The smell, however, reminded me of what you would smell if you were on the set of a nasty version of a Hoarders TV episode.  Must be an acquired taste.

For the main course, we chose the short rib ravioli and the cavatelli.  Both were excellent, especially the ravioli.  No complaints at all.

i'm not a big fan of tomato soup, in fact, i never eat it, but i tried the bisque and loved it. it tasted more like a tomato sauce than soup. the arugula salad was great as well. the crab cake sandwich was really small but good, and the salumi sandwich was amazing... probably my favorite part of the meal. both pastas were good, but i personally preferred the orecchiette, the cranberries sealed the deal for me.

f9LuLzqLMNJJoV3zmu6dBA,F4wKko5t9kxR97EtDtxUbg,"In my opinion, Casbah is the best of the big burrito restaurants. I have been to Casbah for dinner and drinks a few times. During my latest experience, I was impressed by the hearty fall entrees. I decided to take my husband to Casbah for his birthday on friday night. I called on Monday and luckily, I was able get a reservation without a problem. When we arrived, the restaurant was packed but we did not have to wait. We were sat in the beautiful front covered patio area. 

We decided to start our meal with the veal and pork meatballs. This was my favorite part of the meal. I could have ordered 3 of these for my entree! The polenta and the crispy brussel sprouts added a smoothness and a salty crunch. Delish. You have to try these! For my entree, I ordered the double cut pork chop and my husband ordered the cioppino. The huge pork chop arrived medium well, as requested, but was still tender and juicy, even better when dipped in the sage jus. In additiion, the bitterness of the braised kale paired well with the smooth, creamy parmesan and proscutto risotto. My husband was also a big fan of the cioppino. The mussels, clams, shrimp, halibut and scallops were cooked to perfection. I was equally impressed with the size of the scallops. We're talking the width of a coffee cup! Unfortunately, we were too full for dessert but were presented with housemade salted carmels to end our meal.

ytgLwKzD6B4af5vW56RpJg,4thLKcbduhLVVo6ufy7sCA,"I love the Big Burrito group and I love even more that they just sent out a bunch of coupons. The other night, I got off early from work and was able to go to Casbah for dinner during the week. 

When we got there, they took a minute to figure out where we would sit even though it appeared that they were empty. However,  1/2 way through dinner it seemed like they were seating those with reservations inside and walk ins outside. 

The place is set up with what would be the patio, enclosed. There are big heaters on the ceilings that are directed straight at the tables. I will say that it was a little too warm and even though the host said he would turn them down, I don't think that was done. 

The waitress came and told us about the menu, took our drink orders and brought us some bread with a yogurt spread and salted butter. I did ask her if the $10 off entrée coupon could be used on the pasta entrées and I think at that point she began to think that we were poor young kids. But back to that later. . . 

To start we shared the crispy calamari ($11) with capers, lemons, chili and parsley which was probably some of the best calamari ever. It was not chewy and it had the best sauce ever! We also ordered the grilled chickpea flatbread appetizer ($9) which I expected to be a flatbread but actually came as grilled pita with three separate dips - baba ghanoush, hummus and red pepper muhummara. 

For dinner, I ordered the short rib ravioli ($24) which came with swiss chard, oyster mushrooms, roasted shallots and gremolata. This was the more decadent dish ever! When it first came, it had about 6 raviolis and didn't appear to be enough but it was more than enough!

My husband ordered the Casbah Double Cut Pork Chop ($27) which came with braised kale, prosciutto & parmesan risotto, garlic cream and a sage jus. The pork was very moist and the risotto was cooked perfectly. There were no left overs!

After this huge meal, we decided on taking a dessert to go. We both agreed upon the Dark Chocolate Rasberry Bread Pudding ($8). So I asked the waitress if it would travel well since we wanted to take it to go. At that time, she looked at me and asked if we had a toaster oven where we lived. . . Um yes lady we do, in fact we have an oven also AND we own our own home. Despite the comment, we took the dessert home and put it in the oven later that night and we were not disappointed. 

Overall the meal was delicious, we got to use two $10 off coupons and I would highly recommend it to anyone. However, I still favor Eleven!",0,2SwC8wqpZC4B9iFVTgYT9A,0,4,2012-11-18,review,0

I will add that the food portions also seem to be decreasing! We went during happy hour last week and I had the worst tasting rye drink possible - described as rye with fig jam, bitters and lemon, sounded like something that cannot possibly be fucked up, but tasted like nothing but the juice wrenched out of unripe lemons - super dry and gave me a stomach ache. No fig flavor to be detected. To make matters worse, when my partner tried to ask the bartender about the drink, if it was supposed to be sooo god-aweful lemony, she responded with a ""yes, it's got lemon in it."" When he pressed the issue, she simply repeated, ""yes, it's a lemon and fig drink."" More frustrating than conversations with the wall. The risotto that we ordered was the size one would expect of a side dish (which is what risotto should be, but this was proposed as an entree...). It had about 5 little pieces of maitake mushroom and 6 hazelnuts in it and was otherwise flavorless. We added lots of salt and pepper. Total waste of $25 bucks. 

Also, their bar seating sucks. The chairs are stationary and far away from each other, and a bit far from the bar for a shorty like me; my feet don't reach the foot bar on the chair either, so my legs fall asleep trying to sit there.",0,2SwC8wqpZC4B9iFVTgYT9A,0,2,2012-12-18,review,0

Bit of a complex review.  My biggest gripe with Casbah is that it's Casbah Mediterranean when the menu (at least on this night, but I don't think it changes all that much) offers very authentic Mediterranean dishes.  One lamb dish (not overly Mediterranean) and no couscous or tagine, which are major staples of Mediterranean cuisine.  Even a side of hummus and pita or veggies would be nice.  Nonetheless, the menu has lots of fine options, just none that I've seen in a typical Mediterranean joint.  I think it's a little misleading especially if you're seeking Mediterranean cuisine.

We sampled several of the cocktails, all of which were creative and well priced.  As for food, we split the bruschetta (prosciutto and blue cheese), meatballs (pork) and the brussel sprouts were quite tasty, beet salad, and the potato gnocchi. So lots of food!  All was freshly prepared with quality ingredients and served with sophisticated presentation.

Q3fFv_ft17OyV-NRF1iQxw,WQZLbjXNp2IdJdx_qaf9ig,"When scoping around online for a good NYE dinner destination for my husband and me, Casbah's prix fixe menu really jumped off the page! Since the Big Burrito group is so popular, I was happy to get reservations, especially since a lot of times were already booked.

The hubby and I arrived a few minutes early for dinner. I had planned additional time to park and was delightfully reminded that Big Burrito restaurants have free valet parking -- so great, especially with slushy snow on the ground! Even though we were a few minutes early, the hostess took our coats and seated us immediately.  

Service was extremely attentive from start to finish. Waters were re-filled quickly. Bread was brought to the table almost immediately and we were offered another basket as soon as we finished the first. The bread came with a delicious spread - was it goat cheese? - that I just couldn't stop eating. Silverware whisked away with each course was promptly replaced.

We ordered both the land and sea courses to share so we could try the entire NYE prix fixe menu. None of the eight dishes disappointed! The first courses were Sea Scallops & Octopus and Duck Confit. The sea scallop was perfectly cooked, the octopus - thought not my cup of tea! - was also well cooked, and the balsamic flavor in the dish was very tasty. I absolutely loved the duck confit dish. It was served with mustard greens and fruit with a to-die-for dressing - a delicious combination!

The second courses were Potato Gnocchi and Mushroom Tortelloni. The gnocchi was served with lobster, which was a unique but nice paring. Though a strongly flavored dish, the tortelloni was delicious, and I enjoyed another unique paring, tortelloni with chunks of beef short rib.

Lake Ontario Walleye and Roasted Veal Strip Loin were the third courses. Both were cooked to perfection. The walleye's skin was perfectly crispy, and the veal strip loin was cooked medium well but was still deliciously juicy and tender. However, a component of each dish was disappointing -- a mustard flavor in the walleye and pickled mustard seeds covering the veal. I really can't hold this against Casbah though. I'm just not a fan of mustard!

Finally, the desserts was fantastic! The Chocolate Ganache Tart was the ending of the sea courses. The chocolate was strong, even a little bitter, and was served with a little champagne strawberry compote. I grew more accustomed to the bitterness with each bite, and it was the perfect ending to three courses filled with fish. A Caramel Macaroon completed the land courses. The macaroon was delicious and served with a little apple sorbet and caramel sauce.

Our experience at Casbah was spectacular! Based on this experience, I debated giving the restaurant five stars... but decided to wait until I returned a second time. And I can't wait to return!",0,2SwC8wqpZC4B9iFVTgYT9A,0,4,2013-01-06,review,1

The sour dough bread was soooooo good. Most everyone else ordered pasta dishes and thought them very good. We opted not to have dessert there but they did bring salted Carmels to the table with the check so if they were any prediction of the desserts they are EXCELLENT.

After we looked through both the wine selection (outstanding) and the menu (delicious), we decided to do things a little differently. Instead of ordering just two entrees, we wanted to sample as many libations and treats as possible.

First, we ordered the white wine flight, and split a few seafood appetizers; then, we ordered the red wine flight, and split a few meaty appetizers; and, finally, we each ordered a glass of our favorite red and split a chocolate ravioli with raspberry sauce dessert. 

Our bill was quite pricey, but I feel totally worth it. Every single thing we drank and ate was delicate, perfect, satisfying, and well balanced. I would go back and spend the money any time!",0,2SwC8wqpZC4B9iFVTgYT9A,0,5,2013-03-03,review,1

In fact, her thorough and enthusiastic descriptions of each course (including each cocktail and cheese) were a highlight of the meal. Sometimes over the top (""people say it's the best meal they have had in their life"" and ""the chef took this week off so he could enjoy the meal as a customer--and it brought a tear to his eye"") but we genuinely loved it. 

First, she made excellent suggestions on the cocktail (mimosa) and she helped us decide on the rest of the meal. Her recommendation to split the truffle dinner and add an appetizer was perfect. We left completely satisfied. 

The cheese was very good and the accoutrements well-paired. When I saw it on the plate, I didn't think it was very much but it ended up being the perfect amount.

The new tuna tartare appetizer was the highlight of our night. The bruschetta with fig and grape butter, prosciutto and blue cheese was good, so was the beet salad.

We were disappointed with our entrees. My roasted duck breast with spinach and gnocchi was not hot. My date had the salmon with potato fennel puree, which she said tasted fishy.

Make sure you aren't seated inside the tent where patrons are eating on a slope on outdoor metal tables--this is not my idea of a good dinner at this price range.

Casbah is a great local place that serves smaller (but admittedly pricey) portions, and they change their menu up frequently to match the ingredients available to them each season.

The set-up is...different? I couldn't quite figure out what was going on with it; you basically walk into a door and enter what looks like what was once a courtyard, which was covered with a canvas - maybe they take this down during the summer? Possibly? I'm not sure; anyway, if you walk to the back of the courtyard you'll get into the actual bar.

The menu here, at least during my visit, was delicious - fantastic fresh sangria, a very interesting but tasty bruschetta (that, rather than going with the traditional tomatoes and basil, was covered in a kind of cream cheese, greens and nuts), and a reasonably portioned bowl of pasta with sausage and spinach. Not complaints, other than the fact that the pasta was a bit spicy and I wasn't warned about this. It wasn't too strong, though.

Our waitress was doing the best that she could (I think) but was a little slow. Still, the place was fairly busy and I had good company to talk to during my meal, so no hard feelings on that one.

I say give this place a try if you have the money to spare - and even then, get a coupon or a Groupon; I went with someone who was using a birthday gift card, and it helped the pricing tremendously.",0,2SwC8wqpZC4B9iFVTgYT9A,0,4,2013-04-11,review,0

We have been to several business dinners in their space downstairs, and it really is my favorite place for these - even more than the pricier steakhouses 'dahntahn.'

Wait staff were very attentive, and really made our experiences here great. Food was served efficiently for large groups, and arrived at the correct temperature. They have a great wine list, and overall offer a comfortable space with delicious food and drinks. Try the lamb loin, chicken, and cioppino - my three current favorites.

Fiona behind the bar is always welcoming and fun and is perhaps one of the best bartenders in the city. It's also one of only a handful of good restaurants in the city that is open on Sundays.

As with all the other Big Burrito restaurants, I'm definitely a fan of the upscale and unique spin on an ethnic cuisine (in this case Mediterranean).

The fiancee and I's first venture here left us with some of the best scallops we've had in Pittsburgh and a Jamison Farm's lamb shank that was to die for.  I wish I could remember the waiter's name, but all I can say is, he definitely deserved the 40% tip we laid down.

Take two, brunch.  We sat this time out in the covered and heated patio up front.  While the food was great (I got my obligatory fat kid french toast variation), a rushed server caught her arm on the back of my chair towards the end of our meal and dumped an entire pitcher of ice water on my shoulder and lap.

While I'm completely sympathetic when it comes to legitimate mistakes (and the server was obviously extremely embarrassed about the situation), I was surprised when no follow-up occurred.  The server apologized and ran immediately to the back of the house, leaving two of the surrounding tables to come to my rescue with their napkins.  The server brought us our check, but despite the public scene it caused, not a single manager stopped by to verify that everything was alright.

After writing to Casbah, the manager did respond quickly and offer to rectify the situation, so I'll give them a pass assuming it was just bad timing and an issue where the server was too embarrassed to do anything.",0,2SwC8wqpZC4B9iFVTgYT9A,0,4,2013-05-29,review,1

If I'm spending a $150 on dinner for 2 I expect some sort of explanation on why we are having to wait 45 minutes plus between our appetizer and the entrees. At a minimum, I don't want to have to flag down the server to order another drink and for god's sake don't make me ask for a refill of my water.

kWkgwRxqWD-h260dMTkHUA,5UEIzOYhYZPRl2Mz484Gkw,"I stopped by here this past Tuesday night for dinner by myself.  It had been a couple of years since I had last been to Casbah and while I remembered it being decent, it differed a bit from my fiance's opinion that this was the best of the Big Burrito restaurants.  Due to that it had been on my list of restaurants to visit so that I could get a better opinion of it.  The restaurant looked the same that I remembered it with a large outdoor seating area and a smaller one inside with the bar on one side of the restaurant and the dining room on the other.  It was all nicely and tastefully decorated.

I arrived shortly after 5 PM and immediately made my way into the bar area of the restaurant as I hate taking up a table if I am eating by myself.  There was no one else at the bar at this point and the bartender quickly greeted me and gave me a happy hour menu while explaining it to me.  I had not been planning on getting a drink but one of the $6 cocktails caught my eye and I ended up ordering it.  The bartender was pretty friendly guy and explained how he came up with the drink while he made the drink and we chatted for a bit.  For my entrée I decided to order the Long Island Duck which was a roasted breast, braised leg, gnocchi, spinach, rosemary, black mission figs and duck jus.  Whenever I had ordered it I had actually missed the fact that it came with a braised leg and was excited to see that extra unexpected portion of meat on my plate whenever it was delivered to me.  The whole meal ended up being incredibly tasty with the duck breast being cooked perfectly with nice seasoning and not greasy at all.  This was in stark contrast to the leg which was incredibly juicy and greasy which I absolutely loved.  Normally I am not a fan of greasier duck but the two preparations really helped to enhance the other.  Finally the figs provided a nice touch of sweetness while the gnocchi was pillow like and tasty.  It was also nice to be able to taste a hint of rosemary on them which I had forgotten about between the time I had ordered and when it was delivered.

The bottom line for me is that I would definitely head back here again in the future.  Both my cocktail and my meal were really good and I would actually consider this to be one of the best meals that I have eaten in a little while.",0,2SwC8wqpZC4B9iFVTgYT9A,0,5,2013-06-27,review,1

The wine list is pretty good, and the waiters are generally knowledgable about pairings, which is nice, because sometimes you just want to sit back, relax, and let someone else do the work.

You can't go wrong with any of the pastas. It's sometimes fun to split a pasta as a starter. It's a nice way to try a variety of dishes. The orrechiette is a great choice because it combines the tartness of cranberries with the savory creaminess of goat cheese. Yum!

With plenty of time to review the night's menu, we made our selection. My request was well done Salmon (heart issues require well done) the chef's feelings were clear; as I sawed through the salmon I thought it could possibly be a message. I again had offended by my request. I like Casbah and the other BB restaurants but tonight I should have selected a friendlier more customer focused establishment. YES I will return and still recommend Casbah. Oh we did finally get to place a cocktail order.

Good service.  Generally great food (the breakfast pastries, my breakfast polenta and the wife's scallops were fantastic), however inconsistencies still prevent the 5-star praise.

While the coffee is great, the crud in the creamer and a dirty spoon to start the meal off were not.  In addition, I may have had one of the most bi-polar plates of my life...  braised lamb on grilled sourdough.  The lamb itself was kiss-yo-mama good...  seriously, this meat is a fork cutting affair.  However, the bread itself seemed stale and completely took away from the star in the spot light.

As with Eleven, you can't go wrong with the brunch pre-fix, so be prepared to need a wheel barrel to get yourself out the door!",2,2SwC8wqpZC4B9iFVTgYT9A,1,4,2013-12-30,review,2

Q3fFv_ft17OyV-NRF1iQxw,YVOk9ylo8bgaxwFbdNrouA,"I recently realized that I had only given Casbah four stars after my first visit here for New Year's Eve 2012... What a terrible judgment call that was on my part. So I'm back to proclaim that over a year later - having dined here again in 2013 - with a year of dining experiences across the country -  I still regularly dream of this restaurant. Do I dare say it's my favorite restaurant? I'm not sure, but if it's not my favorite, it's certainly close.

We returned after NYE last year to celebrate my birthday in March, making sure to bring along the oh-so-coveted Big Burrito birthday coupon. I ordered the Orecchiette with Chicken, Cranberries, Goat Cheese & Sage Cream. Oh. My. Goodness. Don't order this if you're on a diet... but order this if you love delicious food and living life to the fullest. It was ridiculously creamy, and the cranberries packed the perfect fruity balance to the rich dish. My husband ordered the Double-Cut Pork Chop with Kale & Butternut Squash Risotto. While recently dining at a highly rated restaurant in NYC, he said, ""My double-cut pork chop at Casbah was better than this double-cut pork chop."" That's when I knew that I needed to update my review of Casbah.

Finally, my delicious birthday dinner ended with the Dark Chocolate-Raspberry Bread Pudding. I love ordering bread pudding at restaurants, and I think this is the best of them all. I would confidently enter this dessert in a bread pudding competition, knowing that I would be walking away with the blue ribbon.",1,2SwC8wqpZC4B9iFVTgYT9A,0,5,2014-01-12,review,3
JmjpDIUvwcRfJzL_AkBFlg,XDz0wtai-8YhTQ1UiQJ2dw,"I don't understand the high rankings of this place and why it consistently gets into Pittsburgh's top 3. The food is rather mediocre for the price. I went there twice, both times paying close to $300 for dinner for 3, but the food really didn't stand up to expectations. Sea scallops that I have ordered last time were burned outside and rubbery and chewy inside. Risotto from my previous try was falling apart. But the most annoying thing is that there is way, way too much food on the plate for fine dining place. The appetizer cheese platter that we ordered last time had enough cheese to last for a week! I don't go to places like that to stuff myself... So no, I do not like it overall. Maybe it is one of those ""good enough for Pittsburgh"" kind of restaurants, but then maybe they should think about charging a bit less. Unless they charge for quantity, not quality...

IQIYDSfkFgTBedc3rbw4qw,XiDRXxFYclb5sK4xDzmPcg,"My favorite local place in Shadyside.  My husband and I go for Friday HH (5-7 pm) every time we can.  Juan is great behind the bar, but Fiona and Joe (I think Joe, maybe his name is John?) are awesome as well.  The HH drinks change seasonally but you can always get your choice liquor mixed drinks also.  For $6/drink you can't beat it!

We typically always get the hummus trio as an appetizer with extra pita bread, or the calamari.  All of the entrees we have had (pork belly, risotto, pork chop) have been perfectly prepared, zero complaints.  It's on a pricey side, so not a weekly dinner option for us (unlike the HH!)

I would say the complimentary valet is a perk, but we live within walking distance so haven't used it.

ZDsneygztCiyFpkwSV0oTQ,GdGz5w7Dx0CASRxkoktqvw,"The last time I was at Casbah was on a balmy spring evening in my sophomore year of college. I'd arranged a dinner with my mother in a fancy effort to spring the news on her that I wanted to move out of my college dorm the following year and into a co-ed fraternity house.  I remember being underwhelmed by the food, but that could've been the chilly reception with which I was met during this particular dinner and the conversation that entailed. 

Fast forward fifteen years later (what?!) and I was back at Casbah with Jonathan D. and my future in-laws.  We enjoyed the prix-fixe brunch, and enjoy it we did!  The meal started with a small basket of mini goodies including double chocolate muffins, cranberry almond scones and buttermilk biscuits.  The meal included choice of breakfast cocktail, appetizer and entree. For my selections I chose a bloody mary, Smoked Salmon and Sea Scallop Fry.  Dare I say this meal (with one small exception) rates in my top five of all time?  I dare.  The appetizer was very filling in itself and absolutely sublime for smoked salmon.  The salmon was accompanied by a done-just-right potato pancake that I could eat ten times over.  My main entree consisted of two plump and juicy sea scallops on a bed of sweet potatoes, carmelized onions and sausage (I substituted chicken sausage for the included fennel sausage).  In addition, the entree included a portion of melt-in-your-mouth white corn grits and scrambled eggs that seemed out of place and that I completely could've done without.  A croissant was also included but I asked for fruit instead and was rewarded with a small side of grapes, canteloupe and strawberries.  My fellow brunchers feasted on a variety of Creamy Polenta (looked amazing), a cheese tasting, Lamb and Eggs, and Casbah Benedict. Everyone left smiling and satisfied.  So, if you haven't given Casbah a try in the last decade, it might be time to visit again.  I'm so very glad I did!

We started with two appetizers this time out, the Tuna Tartare and the Sheep's Milk Gnudi. The tuna was very clean, served with nicely grilled sourdough. The Gnudi had a great truffle butter and tarragon flavored sauce. 
I also had my all-time favorite salad, the Arugula. This masterpiece features homemade pancetta, crimini mushrooms, and goat cheese. We split the Ricotta Cavatelli Pasta, prepared thoughtfully with fennel sausage and spinach.

The semifreddo with a chocolate macaron was good, though not of the same quality as the other courses.

The cioppino looked and tasted wonderful (I was given a perfectly cooked scallop), but the pork chop that evening was undercooked (who eats medium rare pork???).

Yes, our dinner group quickly racked up a big bill - but it was for a birthday party, and Casbah had kindly sent along a $30 off dinner coupon beforehand. Even better, they went ahead and applied the discount even though we managed to forget to bring the actual card they had sent ahead to us. We had been completely prepared when asking about this to potentially not be able to use that $30 off at our visit, so their understanding alone would have gone a long way in making the meal a good one.

The amazing food just sealed the deal. Between a table of four we all had the chance to order and then a variety of Casbah's current menu - including their scallops, arugula salad, duck, pork and veal meatballs, and a ricotta very similar to what I had ordered the last time I visited. Everything was stupendously delicious - I honestly have no other words for how good this food was - and we all left full and satisfied with no complaints.

Casbah has definitely become a restaurant that I can come to for special events. Their food and service impressed me again tonight even more than they did last time; add in the fact that they use local ingredients whenever possible and always have something new to try with the changing seasons, and I'm completely sold.

uDIecT9tlTj1XIeqoyZUyg,pKcQEu1QMRLWRuBBLqFU3A,"Big Burrito does it again! Casbah is located on a wonderful, neighborhood street in the Shadyside area of Pittsburgh. We got there a little early and waited a little in the lot. Our reservation was for 11 and they open at 11. We were still told the valet had to move our car. I get they have a way they do things and it must work for them but the lot has about 40 spaces that you can see from the street so I don't know why valet is necessary. We are particular about our vehicles and we don't valet anywhere. Not that the valets weren't nice and it's not like we could not see them move the car but anyway...the main reason they get a 4 and not a 5 star. Onto the meal...

We waited just a few minutes in line to be seated. As I said our reservation was at 11 & that is when they open. We were seated promptly requesting the inside area of their dining room. They do have a very nice, shaded patio area as well complete with ceiling fans. We requested to sit inside and the hostess happily obliged. We were greeted quickly by a happy and knowledgeable waitress who was on it. She was not at all intrusive but our water was never empty and we didn't have to wait long for our check when we were done. She asked if we wanted any other beverage. I got an iced tea and the hubby requested iced coffee. The waitress noted they could make one for him by adding ice to coffee and he said yes. He was very happy they would accommodate his request. 

We ordered our food and were promptly brought a basket of bread (oh the wonderful bread basket!). We got 3 types of amazing breadly goodness that included cranberry scones (wow), biscuits (warm, soft, & the Hubby's favorite), and (my favorite) the lime, coconut muffin (sweet, lime, coconut, what's not to love). Oh, and let us not forget the maple butter, yum! I ordered the smoked salmon app. The combo of salmon, capers, aioli, and truffled potato cake - absolute perfection! There was a salty, smokey, sweet flavor that was sheer joy on my taste buds. The hubby chose the creamy polenta which he thoroughly enjoyed noting it was very oatmeal like. For my entree it was the sea scallop fry minus the caramelized onions. I would SOOOO get this again! The scallops were cooked to perfection with a wonderful golden outside that makes my heart sing with joy (can you tell I love a good sea scallop?). The combo of English peas, fennel sausage, and white corn grits...it was something special for sure! I could eat that sausage by the boat load every single day! And the grits - smooth, creamy, and perfectly seasoned. Not that it needed it but the dish comes with scrambled eggs and a beautifully, buttery croissant. My brunch was so satisfying, Heaven! The hubby chose the eggs Benedict with prosciutto. He liked it but noted he should have gotten the spinach not the prosciutto. He said the prosciutto seemed vinagary. The dish includes paprika roasted fingerling potatoes which were mild and perfectly cooked. And for dessert we chose the chocolate stout cake on a wine caramel drizzle served with a little dish of creme brulee ice cream. Holy cow! What a terrific chocolate cake & the ice cream rocked too. 

Overall, I would recommend Casbah to everyone noting their brunch was fabulous! The valet (even though the need for valet is questionable) and wait staff were super nice, attentive, & knowledgeable.

I'm a huge seafood person so the first time I ordered a Bloody Mary with the smoked salmon to start and sea scallop fry as my main.  I'm a fan of their Bloody, it's spicy and flavorful. The smoked salmon was filling enough that it's easy to split and the truffled potato cake served with it melts in your mouth. The sea scallop fry is everything you would expect, almost too much food, but no complaints.

My second trip to Casbah brunch, I went with my old favorite of the smoked salmon but split it with my friend who ordered the cheese plate. Also, I ordered the Braised Lamb & Eggs as my main based on friends' recommendations. It's honestly to die for. Rich and flavorful in the best way, attributed to the tarragon sauce and the slow roasted lamb, and easily their specialty. If you want to order something you can't get anywhere else, order this.

My chicken was good, not great and a little flavorless. the mustard grits were superb, the lemon pesto kind of tasted like lemon pledge and really over powered the whole dish, which was really disappointing.

RPJGvMZnlsQpk0l_QOK_FA,cFSpRCWAR3Iy3DdUH6MMtA,"Casbah has made my Top 10 Favorite Restaurants in Pittsburgh list. My friends and I went here for one of my friend's birthday. The food was simple yet delicious and transported me back to Greece. Upon being seated, they offered complimentary bread with butter and mascarpone spread. The waiter was very knowledge about the menu and recommended his favorites which included the pork chop entree and that soft shell crabs and corn were in season. As a result, my friends and I shared the soft shell crab app. The soft shell crab was fried to perfection with a small side salad of sliced asparagus and basil with tapenade. The only complaint I had with this dish was that there was only one to share between the three of us. 

For the entrees, I decided to heed the waiter's advice and selected the pork chop while my friends ordered the gnocchi and cioppino. What I am about to describe for the pork chop does not do it justice. The pork chop was cooked to the right temperature and did not lost its juiciness unlike most of my experiences with pork chop. It was also huge because it was double cut. The riscotto and braised kale complimented the pork chop well with the braised kale giving the pork chop an herbal component. I did not think I would be able to finish the dish but when I looked down again, everything was gone. I had the opportunity to try my friends' dishes and they were also prepared in an exceptional way. The veal and lobster in the gnocchi added a welcoming heartiness to the dish and the sauce reminded me of a curry. The unexpected combination of the gnocchi and curry-like sauce pleasantly surprised me. Since I have never tried cioppino until that day, I did not have anything to compare it but I was satisfied with the amount of seafood they gave. The only complaint from my friend was that the grilled bread that came with the dish was too hard for her to use to soak about the sauce. She used the complimentary bread instead and loved the sauce.

While we were ordering our dishes, we mentioned to our waiter that it was my friend's birthday. He brought out a dish of caramel with ""Happy Birthday"" written on it with dark chocolate sauce for her even though we didn't expect anything from them. I am grateful that they brought that dish out. I do not know if the caramel is on their menu but it melted right away in your mouth. 

If you managed to read all the way to the end of this review, you probably are asking why I didn't give Casbah all five stars and I will tell you the reason. Although our waiter went above and beyond to get my friend a birthday ""plate"", the service overall was not satisfactory. Throughout the meal, he did not come over to our table and took a long time getting our checks to us even though we blatantly had finished our dinner for awhile. I have gone to less delicious restaurants who offer better service.

Overall, the food at Casbah is exceptional. They change their menu based on what is in season. Here's a tip: if you sign up for the Big Burrito emails (the parent company of Casbah at https://secure.bigburrito.com/Register.aspx), you will get a free meal voucher on your birthday which is good at any of their restaurants. When my parents come into town, I will be subtly hinting that they take me here.",0,2SwC8wqpZC4B9iFVTgYT9A,0,4,2014-08-11,review,0
6MQjQ3jfCUUxItIvKadJsw,zBYIBSD8LjCJWyFBPVoIkg,"I am definitely the salt queen.  I literally salt everything from pizza, McDonalds French Fries (even though I know that they already have tons of salt on them).  I also salt ham and processed foods.   I always salt food before even tasting it.  Nothing is off limits when it comes to me and my salt shaker.

Well when my beautiful meal arrived I asked my server for the salt.  None of the tables had salt or pepper shakers on them.  As my server went to get me the salt shaker, I took a bite of my potatoes.  Whoa!!!!!  They were extremely salty!!!!   For the first time in my life,  I didn't add any additional salt to my meal.  For me to say something is ""very"" salty.... It is very salty. 

Being the salt queen,  I stll  was able to enjoy and love my meal.  I am almost guarantee that the average person would not have enjoyed this food..  My friend also tasted my meal and immediately noticed the heavy taste of salt.  However he never salts anything so something with one grain of salt on it, he will be about to tell.  

It really suprised me that such an upscaled restaurant would have this much salt added to their food.  I am sure that it was an error or something.  I have eaten here in the past and never experience so much salt.

Still my meal ""for me"" was delicious.  For the first time in my life, I am glad that I did not add any salt to my meal.

For my entree, I had the cioppino -- it may be one of the best that I've ever had. The bowl was filled with beautiful looking seafood: large shrimp, clams in their shells, mussels in their shells, a gorgeous piece of perfectly seasoned halibut, and enormous wonderfully cooked scallops. They knew how to cook each piece of seafood to showcase it well. And the charred sourdough served with the cioppino was the perfect complement to soak up all of the delicious, savory flavors of the broth without becoming a soggy mush! My grandfather had the halibut and loved it... Cleaned the plate!

I had heard rave reviews of the dark chocolate raspberry bread pudding, so we had to share one for dessert! My grandfather said it was incomparable to any bread pudding; it was a sweet, smooth, decadent indulgence that paired well with the house coffee.

And the complementary salted caramels presented with the check were also amazing! I definitely need to come back again to try more of the menu... I think only wonderful items could possibly come out of that kitchen!",0,2SwC8wqpZC4B9iFVTgYT9A,0,5,2014-09-23,review,0

I immediately noticed that a lot of CMU undergrads worked there. While I was dining there I saw 3 CMU classmates. 

I started off with the gazpacho and it was very tasty. We were also given some bread with a lavender goat cheese spread. The spread was ok. 

For the entrees I got the roasted pepper cavereccia that had crab in it and ricotta cavatelli with sausage.

For the cavereccia I thought there was going to be big chunks of crab but I was disappointed to see that the crab was shredded into small pieces. The pasta was a little undercooked and the sauce was ok.

The cavatelli was extremely oily. The more you ate it the more you saw the pool of oil it was swimming in. I had to wipe some of the oil off the pasta. 

Lastly I had the dark chocolate raspberry bread pudding. It was pretty good but I wish there were more raspberries in it. 

Service was pretty good and the decor outside was nice, although, it got really stuffy in the outdoor tent.

I went there for my birthday dinner and was ready to order it when the waiter explained that they removed it from the menu despite it being one of their most popular dishes. What a total let down.

When my food came out, there was a very visible hair on my plate. I was with a large group and did not want to make a scene, so I mentioned it to the server who immediately took my plate away. The manager on duty came out to apologize, which I did appreciate. However, I was a little surprised because when they brought my plate out about 5 minutes later, I could tell that it was the same exact plate. 

First off, it was not even warm, so if they made my meal on the spot you would think it would be hot, or at the very least warm. I had also substituted bacon for the sausage that normally comes with the entree, and if the chef had made a new plate on the spot, he would probably have sent it out with the sausage (or with a side of bacon again), which he did not (they had served my bacon on the side when they brought it out initially).     Everything was in the exact same place on the plate. I wasn't going to cause a scene, so I pretended to enjoy it, but did not. I was quite repulsed.

in my last review I had said that Casbah was my favorite restaurant in Pittsburgh. I had mentioned that the Cassericia dish was my favorite but that they had removed it from the menu the last time I tried to order it there for dinner. I received a response from someone at the restaurant that she was not sure why I would think that because it is still offered, and I explained that the waiter told me it was removed from the menu. 

I'm not really sure what happened here, but I can tell you this... I don't think that Casbah is my favorite anymore. In fact not only is it not my favorite, it has taken a plunge to the bottom of my list of places to eat. 

For me, if you expect to eat at a top restaurant, the service should be top of the line, and it has just been too inconsistent for my taste. No thanks Casbah!",1,2SwC8wqpZC4B9iFVTgYT9A,2,2,2014-11-30,review,1

Also, the desserts are mandatory!  

The duck confit gnocchi is smashing-- it's a nice balance of slightly sweet and very savory--and my favorite is probably the Casbah Double-Cut Pork Chop: super-yum comfort food.  The short rib ravioli is some pot-roasty Goodness, and the long island duck is another great choice.

9OZH1Ecw-qUkCW5MS0NefA,c_OfFAXTywYkhsV4DgTpSw,"Upon receipt of the much-coveted Big Burrito birthday voucher, I had to make the tough decision about which of their restaurants to visit.  I was torn between Casbah and Eleven, but upon perusing the menus, reading reviews, and giving the matter much thought, I settled on Casbah.  I knew I'd made a good decision when I invited some friends to join me, and they said that, based on their past experience, I'd made an excellent choice!

Our meal started off with a few slices of bread, which came with butter and a Greek yogurt spread.  The butter was good, but the yogurt spread was amazing, and both of them dressed up the bread very well.  We then ordered an appetizer of the bruschetta, which was not your normal bruschetta, but was delicious.  I'm not entirely sure of the ingredients, since what we received doesn't match the menu description posted on the website, but one notable thing about it was that it had some pomegranate seeds that gave it a subtle sweetness and juiciness, complementing the other savory ingredients.  For my entree, I ordered the orecchiette, a dish consisting of ear-shaped pasta tossed in a goat cheese and sage cream sauce, with chicken and dried cranberries.  Flavorwise, this was one of the most well-balanced dishes I've ever eaten, with the savory ingredients and sweet hints from the cranberries (which were actual cranberries, rather than craisins, as I'd imagined) melding together in perfect culinary harmony.  The pasta was also cooked to a perfect al dente firmness, which held up well in the microwave several days later when I ate the leftovers.  The cranberry-lime dry soda that I ordered to go with this entree complemented it very nicely, and was a great alternative to wine (while I was tempted, I didn't order any since my dining companions decided not to, due to having driven).

My two dining companions ordered the Scottish salmon and the gnocchi, respectively.  Based on the samples that they provided me, Casbah did a great job on these dishes, as well!  The salmon had a subtle saltiness that complemented the flavor nicely, without overpowering it.  My friend who ordered it had had it before at Casbah, but had since been to Scotland, and he said that it was very similar in quality and taste to the versions of this dish that he'd tried there.  The gnocchi was one of the most unique and varied dishes I've encountered, and, based on the two bites that I tried, brought the ingredients together in a medley of flavors and textures.  I think my friend who ordered it described it best by saying that every bite was a bit different, but that they were all delicious!  Although all of us tried bites of each other's dishes, we each liked our own choice best, so we chose well.

After our entrees, we decided to order dessert.  Although I was tempted by the dark chocolate raspberry bread pudding, since many reviewers speak highly of it, I decided to follow my instinct and get the chocolate-hazelnut bomba.  I'm so glad that I did, since this dessert was amazing!  If you like dark chocolatey, torte-like desserts or Nutella, this dessert is a must-try. Since I mentioned I was at Casbah for a birthday dinner, the dessert was served with ""Happy birthday"" written on the plate in chocolate icing, which was a nice touch.  My dining partners ordered the creme brulee to split between themselves, which came topped with an apple compote.  Based on the bite that I tried, it was a good rendition of a brulee, but couldn't match the star power of the chocolate bomba.

We visited at 7:30pm last Sun., at the later end of their serving hours, but service from our waiter, Brian, was very good.  We were seated in the tent-like area in the front of the restaurant, which stayed surprisingly warm during most of our visit.  At one point before dessert, upon returning from the restroom, I noticed that it'd cooled off, but the manager came out to turn on the heating elements, and it warmed back up in less than 10 min.

In sum, if you're looking for a solid fine dining experience with innovative, delicious food, Casbah is a great choice.  The food was impressive in its quality, and the service was what I've come to expect at a higher-end restaurant.  I'd particularly recommend getting on the Big Burrito mailing list to receive a $30 birthday voucher and $10 off coupons for the holidays, and taking advantage of one of these occasions to try it.  I'm certain that you'll be as pleased with your experience there as me and my dining partners!",5,2SwC8wqpZC4B9iFVTgYT9A,3,5,2014-12-18,review,11

plNKzNhFP4fzAvfBlfET7Q,NPZ8LC01jDLp-Rpy3yVb_Q,"At this time, I have officially had every meal of the day at Casbah (it's great!). Here are my thoughts from my three visits:

First time was for dinner (June 2014) with my Big Burrito Birthday Coupon. We sat outside, where it was pleasant even though it was the middle of the summer. They were generous with the table bread and I really liked their goat cheese yogurt spread. I got the Orrechiette chicken pasta and BF got the filet mignon. The pasta was ok (see lunch review for update) and came in a large portion. The filet mignon was perfection. I made BF share with me :) The roasted potatoes with the green chutney were also heavenly. Definitely a lovely way to spend my birthday.

Second time was for a weekday lunch with a college friend visiting (Nov 2014). We had the 2 $10 off entree coupons and ordered off the Gusto menu (a fancy version of Panera's You Pick Two). I got the Orrechiette again and a Turkey Avacado Sandwhich. The pasta was delicious this time, so I'm thinking it was just one-uped by the Filet Mignon at dinner. Friend got the vege risotto which she liked. I like that Casbah is willing to customize plates at no extra charge or nuisance - they removed all bacon items from my entire meal and replaced them with other dressings, etc. I really appreciated that. Even without the coupon the Gusto lunch menu is a great deal!

Third time I went for brunch with another girlfriend (Dec 2014)
. I LOVE BRUNCH and Casbah took the cake. The table scones, pastries etc were delicious as was the accompanying cinnamon butter. Our waiter was very nice and helpful and was again quick to help customize my vegetarian friend's needs. I got the Mimosa which was delicious. Smoked salmon appetizer was as good as the other yelpers say and the portion was humongous. Finally, I got the scallop omelette and they had no issue giving me my favorite home fries as the side instead of the grits. Friend got the salad appetizer and the spinach eggs benedict. She loved the eggs not such a big fan of the arugula salad (which I have had and liked). We each had a $10 off brunch which made this a steal :) We were able to sit outside even in the winter which was nice.

All in all, I love Casbah. I'm a student so it's a little expensive for me. But I go every chance I get. Look out for Big Burrito coupons!",0,2SwC8wqpZC4B9iFVTgYT9A,0,4,2014-12-31,review,0

The drinks we ordered from the bar were watery (the Manhattan and some drink with applejack in it). Later, they made a mistake and sent us the wrong cocktail, which turned out to be much better than the ones we wanted. 

Appetizers (meatballs with Brussels sprouts and beet salad) were very good, but the main courses left a lot to be desired in terms of seasoning.

The house-made pastas are always a great option if as is the duck or the lamb which I've had both on a few occasions.  Their wine list is always spectacular - on this visit I had a glass of the Riesling from Urban, Germany and my friend had a glass of Pinot Grigio from Lenotti, Italy.  We had no room for dessert on this visit, but any of their desserts that have the Meyer lemons is always a hit and I am a die-hard chocolate fan and I will forgo chocolate for one of their delicious meyer lemon dessert creations.  I haven't been to Casbah for brunch in quite some time, but after having gone to Eleven recently for brunch, I'm keen to try Casbah for brunch again soon.",0,2SwC8wqpZC4B9iFVTgYT9A,0,5,2015-01-07,review,0

The cheese plate was extremely large and really good.  There was a nice balance of cheese to eat.

My date and I both ordered pasta dishes.  When a restaurant makes their own pasta from scratch, how do you order anything else?  The non-pasta dishes that went past our table looked great, but I think we made the right decisions.

My date had a pasta with scallops and crab.  It was amazing.  I had a pasta with kale and sausage.  It was equally amazing.  I felt Casbah was heavy on their sauce.

Casbah has a large wine selection, but I felt the stand out option was the port wine flight for desert.",1,2SwC8wqpZC4B9iFVTgYT9A,0,4,2015-01-11,review,1
BQ1ugiGs7IfwadvqUZFHcw,HeLQOtXkNwis_33VV6RZZQ,"I had my first experience with Casbah on a recent Friday night in a group of 4 without a reservation arriving around 9pm. Here is a summary of our experience: 

PROS: 
- Ambiance is nice, upscale, not too loud. 
- We were able to find a low table in the bar within 15 minutes. 
- Drinks were good, generously proportioned. Cocktails were priced as expected for the type of place ($10-$14). Wine list had multiple options by the glass.
- As for the meal, the meats were good cuts, well prepared. 

CONS: 
- Overall the food felt rich with creams, fats, salt without any particular inspiration showing through. The ingredients were all good and well sourced, but the finished products did not seem to elevate them in any particular way. 
- The service was high end of amateur - not what I was expecting from this caliber of restaurant. Our 30 minute wait stretched to 1hr 30min without any meaningful acknowledgement by the staff. Upon sitting we were told that they usually have ""excellent sourdough bread"", but they were out of it for tonight so we had ciabatta (which was fine, but we didnt need to hear what we didn't get to have). 

FOOD: (vegetarian options reviewed directly, meat options as reported by dining companions)
- Cheese plate: Nicely prepared with a good range of cheeses. Only complaint was that the cheeses were served too cold to fully appreciate them. 
- Beet salad: the greens were good, the dressing was a bit too mild to offset the beets, the beets themselves were gritty and not particularly well cooked. 
- Squash soup: Overall very good - quite rich but flavorful. Felt like the salt and cream were taking over the squash 
- Mushroom pasta: Again quite rich and salty. Packed with high quality mushrooms but didn't feel that they were quite given justice due to the salt and butter. Pasta was high quality but again, overshadowed by the salt and butter. 
- Steak: Good cut of meat, cooked well.
- Ragu pasta: Excellent pasta dish well cooked, reported to be almost as good as Piccolo Forno's. 

OVERALL: 
A similar experience at 2/3 the price would have received 3 stars, for the price of the meal this was barely a 2 star event. We won't be going back, even with the lure of 2 for 1 entrees around our birthdays - the food just isn't that good even discounting the service. I'm sure they will continue to do well with a certain crowd, but there are much better dinner options out there.",0,2SwC8wqpZC4B9iFVTgYT9A,0,2,2015-01-19,review,1

We were seated outside along the catwalk (aka, the walkway from the front door into the main restaurant). It was a chilly night, so the heaters above us were pumping out the heat. I mean, it wasn't warm, it was h-o-t. Yes. It was better than freezing our tooshes off, but it was a bit, well, uncomfortable to say the least.

Now onto the positives...

We devoured the Veal & Pork Meatballs for an appetizer. The Anson Mills polenta, roasted tomato, garlic, crispy Brussels sprouts, and parmigiano-reggiano played very nicely together.

For our main entrees, I ordered the gnocchi. This wasn't just any gnocchi. Instead, duck confit, brussels sprouts, figs, lacinato kale, thyme, pecorino romano, and shag bark hickory nuts accompanied the fluffy little pillows of goodness.

He ordered the Casbah double-cut pork chop served with braised kale, prosciutto & parmesan risotto, garlic cream, and sage jus.

No dessert this time - trying to keep my New Year's Resolution.

3e6f5VSI9e3wbRlNAACiDQ,vFneldeIjQecQMRrYP6Acg,"I think Casbah is a bit underrated. Pittsburgh has a number of very good restaurants: Legume, Meat and Potatoes, Butcher and the Rye, Eleven, and Cure make up the pentagon of the best places in town. Casbah, along with Salt, are in that second tier.

My partner and I have been here for dinner twice. Each time, I thought the food was very good. I can't remember what my order was the first time we came here, but the most recent time I had a mushroom bisque soup, meatballs and the gnudi for the appetizers (split between the two of us), and the sea bass for the entree. I really enjoyed the mushroom bisque, but it's definitely for those who like strong mushroom flavors. The sea bass came on a bed of delicious polenta, which: I don't usually expect polenta to be amazing, but this one was. The sea bass itself was moist and flaky with tons of flavor. My partner had the lamb, and thought it was good but also suspected it might have been too raw inside (it was more than pink). The drinks were also quite good, if not stellar.

Casbah also has a very pleasant atmosphere, even though it's quite large inside. The wait staff is helpful without being in the way; one of my least favorite things is having a waiter or waitress ask me within seconds of getting my food how everything is (give me a few minutes to actually eat it, ok?) and mercifully nothing like that happened here.

The menu is refined Mediterranean with some modern twists. The waitstaff is attentive, timely, and always takes care of my food allergies. I always order sea bass or some sort of fish here, because they sear it to perfection. The chef actually made up their own side for my dish because I was allergic to the one on the menu. I received delicious crispy potatoes and sauteed arugula. Fantastic touch! They have a great wine list, as well.

All I did was confirm that I still wanted to be subscribed to their email list and they sent me a free lunch entree for responding. I decided to use this coupon to try one of their restaurants that I haven't yet.
YUM. I decided to go with the Piccola Gusta option, so that I could try a bit of everything. I went with the arugula salad, gnocchi and sword fish sandwich. It was all outstanding.
Unfortunately there was a large dark hair in my salad that I noticed immediately (thank goodness) and our waiter took care of it promptly. A lot of times I would let that ruin my experience but I tried very hard to not let it. Anyway, finished the meal with the carrot gob. Again, yum!!
Our service after that was just okay. He seemed to kind of forget about us? It was a bit odd. At one point we had no forks for a while with entrees in front of us. I guess I always expect something a little more as far as service when something like a hair accident happens.
The food makes this place hands down as long as there isn't hair in it! We sat in the covered indoor porch area which was cute for lunch, but honestly seemed as though they segregated people by their appearance in who sat inside when going in to use the restroom.

I had the smoked salmon appetizer and the sea scallop entree. The scallops were perfectly prepared, not chewy or gummy.

My boss decided to treat us all for lunch so I looked for something that appealed to me. I must admit that the menu scared me at first. It's definitely more of an upscale kind of place, but not quite a ""suit & tie"" affair. I settled on the bacon and turkey club. Seemed safe. 

I didn't think it was anything amazing. Yes, I said it. I've been looking forward to eating here, too! The sandwich was just sort of... plain. The sauces were bland and did nothing for me. It all just seemed very dry. Aside from the tasty bread and bacon, I wasn't too impressed. For a cheaper price, I could have ordered a club sandwich from a mom and pop's greasy spoon and been more satisfied. 

I also ordered a salad which consisted of lettuce and beets. Dressing was okay, but a little tangy. 

All in all, I'd like to return and actually enjoy a meal in the restaurant. Atmosphere does a lot for a place so a trip back is definitely in order. Also, I'd like to actually study the menu and ask some questions to make sure I can order something good. At work I was a little rushed to make a decision.

CrM3Az65uEB7BBC7G7Begg,kGw0vxwTMwqrWyl5di4GzA,"I want to start by saying that it kills me to give Casbah two stars and I wish there were two rating systems - one for the food and another one for service since my review is really about the latter. The food as always is exceptional.

I have been going to Casbah for well over a decade and it is a place where my family has always celebrated special occasions because of the wonderful atmosphere, food and the great service - or what used to be great service. 

We went to Casbah last night for dinner to celebrate a family birthday expecting to have a nice, memorable evening. Alas! that wasn't to be. Our server (Seth) and the service provided by him can be described in just one word - INDIFFERENCE. He went through the motions of taking our order and bringing us our food but that was it. We were never told of any specials. We were not brought any bread till we asked for it. We were not asked for re-fills on our drinks or even our water. We were not once asked how the food was and if we needed anything else. On ordering dessert, we were not asked if we needed coffee or drinks to go with and so on. In my book, indifference is worse than bad service.  

I could have looked past it if it was just the server's style and lack of work ethic (every place has some of those people!) but what really highlighted this lackluster service was that the very same server was providing exceptional service to a neighboring table with a much larger party than ours. Perhaps because gratuity was automatically included? I don't know but suffice to say I was very disappointed and somewhat annoyed. 

Casbah is not your ""neighborhood"" place to drop in for dinner and the food and ambiance don't come cheap. So the least they can do is to make sure that service is consistent. It is relatively easy to attract new customers but really tough to sustain them.  I hope this was just a one-time occurrence but I feel like I need to highlight it in a public forum in the hope that someone from Big Burrito sees this and has it addressed. 

I'm so disappointed. I hope I can go back there again. I would hate to lose this place!",0,2SwC8wqpZC4B9iFVTgYT9A,0,2,2015-02-25,review,1

68vjXoLMogT5p1jb8enlVQ,1Jeau2W3WyFD9uAFTM_O0Q,"Although we've only had brunch here, I'm not totally sure that we'll be back for dinner service.  Casbah is a whopping .2 miles from home (that's at least a thousand feet!) so while its convenience and accepting of reservations reign high on my list of must-haves, the food left me slightly disappointed.  Considering the price point here, we've dropped a star level or so.

I made reservations for brunch (definitely do this; the place was full when we arrived at noon) and strolled through the patio(?) area to the actual(?) restaurant.  That set up is strange itself; especially with no indication of where I'm headed.  We were quickly seated in close quarters with our other lovely brunch eating brethren.  Service was fine.  We're easy guests, and our waiter was more than tolerant with the +1 having not scoured the menu to make sure he would like something there like I had.  We both opted to go with the prix fixe; with most items hitting the halfway point, 28 bucks seemed great for including an appetizer and cocktail.

My bellini was done right.  Fancy style, making all the schnapps (ha! sorry).  The appetizer of granola with a lil' yogurt that seemed more like cream cheese fatty goodness than the very vanilla yoplait lite I typically let myself have; a sprinkling of berries hit the spot.  Sweet enough for me--maple-y and rich--and didn't even for a second seem like someone poured some Nature Valley in a bowl.  The +1 ordered the cinnamon killed polenta and couldn't get enough.. so I barely got any.

Our entrees though are a different story.  +1 got the mushroom and goat omelet with his little roasted potatoes and his little sausage and his little toast and was all happy enough with it. I am not so easy, I guess.  The brioche French toast sounded great.  Caramelized pear! Sold!  I received, next to a large, meaty chicken sausage link, a few small pieces of fruit and one slice of French toast.  How is that a thing?  Maybe this is the husky child in me, but I was not expecting one slice.  Luckily with the prix fixe, there was no way I would have been able to eat more than one, but really.  If I had only ordered that at some double-digit menu price, I would not be a happy camper.

Overall, really, it was fine.  The food was actually better than I make it sound; it just didn't hit the expectations everyone had set for me.  The hungry girl me will always require more than one slice of sugar bread.  Curiosity of dinner with reservations might bring me back if I don't want to make the trek elsewhere with February arctic conditions again, maybe.",0,2SwC8wqpZC4B9iFVTgYT9A,0,3,2015-03-02,review,1

For the appetizer, I was able to try the Granola, Fruit and Yogurt, the Tomato & Basil Bisque, and the Mushroom and Celery Root Puree, and all were equally delicious. The mushroom and celery root puree I was a little wary of, but it was delicious. 

For the entree, I tried Steak and Egg, Sea Scallop Fry, and the Braised Lamb & Eggs. The portions were substantial and the flavors were all there. The runny yolk with the steak and lamb were glorious. They also have other standard brunch entrees, such as a benedict and waffles, but I felt like this was something you can get anywhere.

Totally different atmosphere and dining experience. It's a pretty romantic setup. When we went (around 8pm on a Thursday), there weren't too many people there.  I felt like the service was good. They didn't treat us like second rate citizens even though we were in casual clothes and I was carrying my backpack (typical student outfit).

We had the tuna tartare, which was lovely. Then, we tried the duck with gnocchi and spinach which was also delicious and a great blend of flavors. For dessert, we had the Chocolate Cheese Cake Bombe, which was just ok. It looked pretty, but the flavors weren't anything special. Oh, they also had really nice house made bread that came to our table warm, crusty and crunchy outside and soft inside.

I can't lie, I love what the Big Burrito group does. I think all their restaurants are awesome, but Casbah was always my least favorite. Now, I feel it is on par with the others!

I love a good prix fixe brunch, and for $28 you receive a cocktail, appetizer and entree. So I started off with a mimosa (always a good start!). Then I ordered the Tomato & Basil Bisque and parmesan crostini, which was excellent. I'm very judgmental of tomato bisque, as it is one of my favorite soups. 

Then came the main course. Braised Lamb & Eggs: braised Elysian Fields Farm lamb shoulder, spinach, poached local eggs, tarragon, grilled sourdough. I love lamb so hard. It's by far my favorite meat, but it has to be cooked with care. This definitely had flavor, was tender and paired perfectly with the spinach and eggs. 

I couldn't finish my meal, so they boxed it up. I separated the sourdough and the rest of the dish so the bread wouldn't get soggy, and our server gave it to me without the sourdough. I mentioned I did that on purpose and he immediately went back into the kitchen and got me fresh bread. How nice is that?

We ordered a bottle Project Paso and it goes perfectly well w the entree. For apps, we had sheep's milk gnudi. It is super tasty and I like the lobster and the lemon sauce together. We had the famous pork chop and the Long Island duck for entree. Both are really good. The duck has the fatty juicy leg separated from the thin nice part, which is really thoughtful and help boost the flavor. The pork is not bad either. But the texture of the meat is a little too dry for my liking. If not for the sauce and the braised kale, the dish would be disappointing. Then came out desserts: the vanilla bean creme brûlée and the chocolate de creme. Omg I can't even find a word to describe how good they are! The creme brûlée is so much better than the one I had in Joseph Temberllini. I am totally blown away by the rich taste of vanilla and eggs. The chocolate de creme is perfect, too.

Initial thoughts: I've heard this place had great food, and since I was quite hungry, I was excited. 

Wait time: We had a reservation, so we were seated right away. 

Service: Great - the waiters were attentive and made sure we were enjoying our meal and had our water glasses filled. 

Appetizers/Small dishes: Cheese tasting with 5 cheese - it was so tiny. Not worth the price. The cheese were interesting, but for the cost I expected more than just a few small slices of bread, a few slices of cheese, and a dollop of jam. 

Main dish: Long Island duck - TOO SALTY. I thought the duck itself was cooked well, but as I was eating it I had to constantly drink water to make up for the taste. There were a few measly pieces of gnocchi. There was no lavender flavor or kumquats. I would recommend getting something other than this dish if you do go. 

Drinks: We ordered a bottle of Riesling, which was good but nothing special. 

Cost: The main dishes were all around $30-35. For the cost, I expected the flavor to wow me, but really I just need a lot of water to drink. 

Ambience: We sat in the part of the restaurant that was under a tent-like structure. It was a bit chilly, but they had the heated lights on. It is dark, so don't expect to take any good photos. 

Overall: Just okay. I wish I could give it more stars, but really it was disappointing. After that unsettling duck main dish, I'm not sure If I'm willing to try this place again.",0,2SwC8wqpZC4B9iFVTgYT9A,0,2,2015-04-11,review,1

I went on their pasta special and got the ricotta ravioli and the short rib ravioli. The ricotta was the second most expensive dish on that menu and we received two saggy, bland pouches of what tasted like a microwaved lunchable. The short rib was doused in a gravy-like sauce that overwhelmed any taste or subtleties that may have existed. Heavy and bland. Not generally what I go out to eat for. 

The service was also extremely slow. 20 minutes to get our bread and 50 to get our appetizers.",0,2SwC8wqpZC4B9iFVTgYT9A,1,1,2015-06-16,review,2

MSuyK2p8G9hEqyWf5IgnYQ,DZ3hSyB7L5kTXRy5uARDEA,"I signed up for my big burrito birthday coupon and knew Casbah was the place I wanted to go to use it! Being that it is a little out of my price range normally, I figured it was the best place to use my coupon and celebrate my birthday! Believe it or not, this was the 2nd Big Burrito restaurant that I have ever been to, Kaya being my first (and I only visited the Sunday prior to coming here on Friday). 

My boyfriend and I made reservations for 6:30 pm on a Friday. We only made them the night before and it wasn't a problem at all. When you arrive, there is complimentary valet parking- how awesome is that? We were sat on the covered patio area, which I really loved. It was a little slanted, which was weird, but our table wasn't thankfully. It was really beautiful- plants and art all around. We started off with drinks- I ordered the white wine flight. Having had a wine flight one other time, I found these to be pretty reasonably priced. I received three small glasses of white wine for $11. Each one was delicious and I really loved how they were all from different places (Austria, Italy and Spain). 

Next, we received bread and two types of butter. One was more traditional and the other was a homemade lemon and herb butter. I really liked them both! For my entrée, I ordered the pork chop. It came with a magical mix of sauces and two side dishes- one that was mainly potatoes and the other being sautéed kale. WOW. The garlic cream sauce was unbelievable, the pork chop was HUGE and literally cooked to perfection. The kale was perfect, not bitter at ALL (how do they do that?)- it was amazing. The portion was huge and I somehow engulfed the entire thing. My boyfriend ordered the short rib ravioli's and loved it- although he preferred my meal over his. I was so full that I skipped the desert. They noticed my birthday coupon and presented me with an adorable little plate with ""Happy Birthday"" written in chocolate and two salted caramels- what an adorable touch! 

Service was perfect, the wine was perfect, the food was perfect... now I see what the fuss is all about. This might be one of my new ""special occasion"" spots-  and we are planning to come back next month for my boyfriend's birthday (I need that pork chop in my life again, stat!).",2,2SwC8wqpZC4B9iFVTgYT9A,0,5,2015-06-18,review,1
Tohk5YKif0q0giiFiNs7BA,bAjHJ9vBMb7anQ9PU-WbMQ,"You can't go wrong with Casbah. Meals and service are deliciously consistent, yet there's enough experimentation to keep things interesting. My dad and I visited this week, specifically, for Pastafest and - as usual - the meal was nothing short of spectacular. 

We began at the bar where I mentioned a favorite drink no longer on the menu: the Malbec margarita. The bartender was quick to dig out the recipe box and whip one up to sweet and sour perfection. Happy hour prices make a stop at this bar one Shadyside's best options for higher end post-work cocktails. 

Seated in the bright (though slightly stuffy patio), we began with Casbah's exceptional calamari. Lightly breaded and fried, the squid was tender and deliciously sauced with a garlicky aioli and the sweet and sour Italian agrodolce (ahhhmazzzing), the combination made for a crave-worthy bite. 

Pastafest provided tasting portions of some old favorites and chef's creations. We shared three: 

Gemelli, jumbo lump crab, sweet corn, guanciale, tarragon: sweet and bright, this dish was summer on a plate.  

Doppio Ravioli, eggplant puree, goat cheese, sweet & spicy peppers, marinated fennel: creamy and rich, the sweet and spicy pepper sauce was just the acidic kick the ravoli needed to balance perfectly.  

Sheep's Milk Gnudi, pork ragôut, baby kale, grilled scallions, orange sea salt, extra virgin olive oil: gnudi is an all-time favorite and the pork ragout was incredibly tender, a gussied up version of BBQ and pasta salad.

We ended our meal with the milk cake which was moist and sweet and lovely with the last few sips of wine. The thing about Casbah? I always leave wanting more, which always keeps me coming back.",0,2SwC8wqpZC4B9iFVTgYT9A,0,5,2015-06-19,review,0

5_GNc6DHiOOSH47ZjmOG_Q,Wbn0-QQfuCyAt4OcHOGpuA,"My boyfriend recently received very exciting news and wanted to go out on the town to celebrate it. My last experience at Casbah was excellent (minus the dining partner but that's another story) so I suggested dining there for this occasion and, since he is not from the area, he trusted my judgment (and my Yelp elite status lol) to choose a great restaurant. I actually made reservations for 8:15pm this past Saturday while I was on the way back from my vacation. Personally, I was quite surprised there was still same day dining availability, but of course I didn't question it. We arrived right on time and used the complimentary valet (get your ticket validated before exiting the restaurant) which was great, particularly since it was raining. We were seated inside and normally I would have rather dined outside but due to the rain, I actually appreciated the inside spot. 

I began with a glass of Malbec (my new favorite go-to wine) and my bf had a Cab. We were brought bread which came with regular butter and another seasoned spread which was more flavorful. The bread was fresh and warm, much appreciated since we were both famished. We started off with a cheese tasting and chose the Jasper Hill ""Harbison""; Vermont, cow's milk, soft; the Sardinia ""Calcagno""; Italy, sheep's milk, hard; and the Misty Creek Goat Dairy Leon ""Leonora""; Spain, goat's milk, soft. The tasting was accompanied by bread (I believe the same we were first served upon sitting down) and three spreads-a mustard, a fig spread, and an additional sweet spread, pinkish in color-possibly pomegranite spread. We both LOVED the tasting and all of the cheeses paired excellently with our red wine! We easily cleared the cheese board. For entrees, my bf had the Ricotta Cavatelli( house-made fennel sausage, spinach, crushed tomatoes, ricotta) and I had the Orecchiette (grilled chicken, dried cranberries, Riverview Farms goat cheese, sage cream). He devoured his pasta, however, I was able to sneak a small bite for it was entirely consumed and it was quite tasty! The sausage had a bit of spice to it that was very flavorful. I absolutely loved the orecchiette! The savoriness of the goat cheese compounded with the sweet tartness of the cranberries was heaven in my mouth! The chicken itself was quite flavorful and the pasta was cooked perfectly, not too firm yet not too soft. Another testament to the greatness of this dish is that my leftovers, heated in the microwave the following day, tasted just as good as the meal did when dining at Casbah! Unfortunately, we were stuffed to the brim and too full for dessert, which will be on the agenda for our next dining experience here. The only criticism I had this go-around was the service. We had a male server who was just not personable, unlike the last time I dined here and the server hit the ball out of the park with her friendliness, multiple suggestions and explanations, and knowledge of the menu. This server never introduced himself, mumbled and talked so quietly it was difficult to hear him, and rarely checked on us. My wine glass sat empty for quite some time before he came around and I had to ask him for a glass as he didn't offer if I'd like another. The main reason for dining out is the food, which was incredibly delicious so I will return, however, I hope next visit the service can match or exceed that of my first visit here since that exceptional service contributed to my wanting to return here again and this particular service made me feel quite undervalued as a customer.",0,2SwC8wqpZC4B9iFVTgYT9A,1,5,2015-06-24,review,1

You should definitely stop in for lunch and get the Piccola Gusto menu - it is a great deal and is plenty of food. You get to try so many awesome things, and it's possible for every component to be vegetarian! It is a way better deal than ordering any one item - they are pretty expensive.

I've also been to a dinner party catered there (in the nice outdoor tent area), and they had a great antipasti platter and various pastas we could try. There were actually multiple vegetarian options, which I really appreciated.

I would give this place a 5, but it would be nice if the vegetarian options experienced as much rotation/creativity as the meat ones.

bhZ13wN_5lQrKX278AP_aw,7wUlOWFVrA8YgFgVizrC6g,"I got my Big Burrito birthday meal voucher in the mail, and I couldn't decide which place to try.  I am a huge fan of Eleven and Mad Mex, but I wanted to try somewhere new.  I had previously sampled Casbah's food when they catered the dinner for Quantum Theater's production of Tamara.  I enjoyed the food at that event so I settled on coming here.

The atmosphere of Casbah is really cute.  It's slightly upscale, but you will still feel comfortable in nice jeans.  There is a Mediterranean theme to the atmosphere, but I don't know that the food is themed that way, despite what Yelp says.

I ordered the Lamb Macaroni and Cheese because I am a Mac and Cheese addict.  The portion was exactly lunch sized, and it came with a small salad.  The salad was really just a spring mix of lettuce with an oil dressing, but it tasted good.  The mac and cheese was delicious.  Plenty of lamb and lots of cheese.  It was on the creamy side of the mac and cheese scale.  I would order it again, but I would also like to try other things on the menu.  My friends ordered a sandwich and one ordered a bowl of soup.  The sandwich eater felt her turkey sandwich was pretty standard, but it was a turkey sandwich.  The soup eater was a fan.  Again, I plan to come back and test other things.

As a side note: The catered meal I previously tried was family-style chicken with potatoes and veggies, I believe.  It was good but not what I would expect after seeing the menu for them to serve.  I think you are safe to try just about anything here, really.

The only odd thing was that the servers really seemed to be fighting for tables.  Everyone was trying to get our drink and food orders, to the point of it being a touch aggressive.  Not a big deal just an observation.",9,2SwC8wqpZC4B9iFVTgYT9A,5,4,2015-07-19,review,9

cocktails/drinks- the list was unimaginative and wife's cocktail was neither refreshing, not very strong. the beers offered were not great, one was flat: 3/10
gnuti- this was somewhat tasty and rich, with well cooked chunks of lobster, however nothing I'll remember tomorrow: 7/10
octopus- the list of ingredients and fact that it is a Mediterranean restaurant makes you think this would be light and fresh w a salty kick from the prosciutto. but it seemed to be cooked with the prosciutto and/or brown sugar and was overcooked, a heavy lumbering dish that not even fennel could make up for. this was a big disappointment. 2/10
halibut-  the fish was well cooked, but the dish was generic, not exciting nor offensive, forgettable. 4/10
Casericcha (sp?)- this really was the standout. The scallops were cooked well and it was chock full of crab. It was very rich. Nothing about the preparation was special, and it wasnt spicy and it was green with pesto so the name red pepper is somewhat of a misnomer, but for the pure weight of fresh lump crab makes this dish 8/10, even with a pretty high price for pasta of $35.
Dessert- milk sponge cake- small and fairly dry, which again, with name ""sponge"" one would be disappointed to expect a moist cake. 3/10.
service- the service was fine, not amazing, seemed like waiter was a little too busy for the higher prices of food. although the ambience on porch was nice, they seemed to have a hard time regulating the temperature, with various times of sweat building on the brow, throughout the meal. 5/10
total: 30/7=4.something and given the price, how good everything looked on the menu and the disappointment of anticipated greatness, I'm rounding down.

2rSeth60_CuWN3ZJ4k41lg,-rxgqm1YhI0HJRwsF04lmg,"We went to Casbah this past Saturday.   It is my birthday month and Big Burrito offers a great deal for anyone who is on their mailing list, providing their patrons with a free entrée up to $30.00 at any of their locations beside Umi.  I chose Casbah since I have been to all of them but this one.

Our reservations were early at 5pm on a Sunday.  We arrived seated quickly in their outside seating area, which is very nice.  We were brought some water while we reviewed the menu.  I decided to start with a Manhattan to drink.  It was very nice, and strong.  Next we decided to order.  Earlier I looked online at their menu and I decided I would be ordering either the Cioppino, littleneck clams, mussels, shrimp, scallops, halibut, grilled sourdough -32 or their Long Island Duck, roasted breast, braised leg, gnocchi, spinach, lavender, peaches, duck jus- 29.  I have had the duck dish at Soba before and loved it, but I wanted to try the Cioppino despite that, since I also love seafood and shellfish.  This I would discover was a mistake.  My partner got the Pork Chop dinner.  We placed our orders and waited.

During our wait they brought some bread.  It was a nice touch; the bread was warm and served with two types of spreads.  By the time our entrées came I wanted another drink and asked for Boyd and Basil - 10 Boyd & Blair vodka, fresh lemon, basil, soda, Angostura bitters, this was one of their signature cocktails.  So we began to eat.  The scallops in the dish were excellent.  Perfect sear and seasoned, as well as the shrimp.  The tiny piece of halibut in the dish and I mean tiny, was so overcooked.  I choked it down but completely unappealing and tiny.  The sauce in this fish soup was also not that great.  The dish came with bread to soak up the juices but the bread itself was burnt and hard.  It actually hurt my mouth to bite it and that was after dipping it in the juices.  I was going to ask for more bread, hold the burn, but our server had not come back.  So I finished the meal and said forget it.  

At this point the drink I ordered was still not delivered.  I was done eating and had to use the restroom so I told my husband if he came back without my drink to tell him forget it and just bring the check.  When I got back to the table that was indeed what happened.  Except he told him he was sorry and if we ordered dessert he would comp my drink.  So when he finally returned, he ordered the Chocolate Cheese Cake Bombe, Pinotage syrup & whipped cream, hazelnuts, praline ice cream, gastrique, when the waiter asked me I simply said no thank you, can I just have the drink I ordered?  He brought dessert and my drink and explained it was ""on the house, and it was their/his fault.""  No biggy really, I was way more annoyed with my meal.  I think what really bothered me was one, how small the entrée was.  It was more suited to be a lunch portion in my opinion.  And then how much it was, but I did have the coupon so I guess I can't complain that much about that.  Simply put if I had spent $32.00 on the meal I got I would have been very upset.  Lastly, the halibut was so overcooked and dry, same with the toast, and the sauce wasn't that pleasant.  All in all I wish I would have gone with the duck.  Live and learn.",13,2SwC8wqpZC4B9iFVTgYT9A,3,3,2015-08-25,review,16
UzGXrITqog05M-mb_9DnxA,1TwGO49g5ZrvRfKcqjTvjw,"Lovely place for delicious Mediterranean food and fine service. We went here for a friend's birthday and Casbah was a festive environment. This place is fine dining but it's not stuffy. I tried to keep my fork and knife and the server made jokes about how that's not their style. In addition, the patio is a nice romantic backdrop with overhanging lights and white curtains.

First let me talk about the drinks. My husband's moscow mule was a little stronger than most places would make it, but they do have the copper mugs. Some places cheap out on that but not Casbah. I had a delicious house Malbec but then switched over to a Grenache and Carignan blend. It was the first time I've had such a mix and I was so happy with my choice that I ended up ordering another glass. It was a wonderfully rich and bold (but not bitter) combination that was a superb pairing to our dinner entrees.

For starters I had the octopus, which was ok but not great. There was too much of a char flavor so it was almost burnt. The tuna however was an explosion of flavor. It was fresh and very flavorful.

For my main dish, I had the duck. I double checked with the waitress when I ordered to make sure the skin was crispy and it was indeed. The meat was perfectly tender and the sauce was sweet and savory.

Everyone at the table thoroughly enjoyed their meals. The lamb shank is so large you need to get a takeaway bag. 

The birthday boy's wife arranged for an ice cream before we got to dinner. The waitress seamlessly distracted us with dessert menus while she got the cake ready, so she really added to the birthday fun.

I have made my own fried softshell crabs before (yes they were alive, and yes I cut their faces off), so I'm no stranger to how they should be prepared and how they should taste.

Pittsburgh is a city that has no shortage of *amazing* restaurants and among those, Casbah is one of the best.

I went with my two kids (foodies at heart and who are both up for anything, always--no chicken nuggets for these two) and our experience, from the moment we crossed the threshold til we floated out after we were finished, was damned close to perfection. 

First off, THE WINE LIST. Sweet niblets. I had a glass of Michel-Schlumberger Pinot Noir that was so good that my eyes actually crossed. CRAZY good. And the rest of the selection was just as impressive. 

We were served a basket of hot-from-the-oven bread with sea-salted butter and this otherworldly strained Greek yogurt stuff with lemon that was so yummy I seriously considered licking the plate. Seemed reasonable at the time. 

Appetizers were flatbread with hummus, baba ghanouj, and red pepper muhummara (sublime) and veal/pork meatballs with crispy Brussels sprouts that earned a resounding ""OMG!"" from the young uns.

The girl child ate--and swooned over--short rib ravioli, the boy devoured (and waxed rhapsodic over) his orecchiette with Elysian Farms chicken, and I lost myself in (and have pledged my troth to) the best cioppino I've ever eaten (San Francisco, eat your heart out).

But wait! There's more!

Dessert. Holy yum balls. Kid #1 had raspberry-chocolate bread pudding with crême Anglaise, Kid #2 had the chocolate cheeesecake bombe. Both kids were over the moon and doing things like pledging to clean their rooms every day (that must've been SOME dessert). 

On top of all this, the service was AH-mazing. Every person who came to the table was funny and smiling and bending over backward to make the meal all it should have been. And it was.

I went with the mushroom and goat cheese omelet but substituted the mushrooms with tomatoes. It also came with toast ( I went with wheat), fingerling potatoes, and choice of a meat-I got the bacon. The omelet was delicious and the bacon was crisp just the way I like it.  We did have to wait a while to get salt & pepper, ketchup and jelly but finally got it all before our food got cold.   Others in my party got the eggs benedicts, shrimp omelet with egg whites and waffles. Everything got good reviews. What I also loved was we got a big pastry basket with biscuits, apple cinnamon muffins and scones.  Al very tasty and a nice starter.  I would really like to go back for happy hour as they have a very nice bar inside.",0,2SwC8wqpZC4B9iFVTgYT9A,0,4,2016-01-17,review,0
6xQnzz_TS0skNM1GIK8j8w,bo4Xw4Fm6bDoEBTNfiD2TQ,"I know this might sound weird, but: My favorite thing about Casbah is the bread. The bread is *apparently* from Eleven and it's amazing. If you go for dinner you get a crusty bread that is sliced thinly and served with butter AND (more importantly) a peppery soft cheese spread. I love this combination. If you go for brunch, they give you a little assortment of bread. I've always received a lime muffin and a biscuit, and last time I went there was a chocolate scone. I can't remember the third option on the visits before, but they have always been good. It also comes with a honey butter that is delicious. One time we even asked for more butter and muffins :) 

The (other) food at Casbah is also very good. I've had a tomato bisque, cauliflower soup, swordfish, different pastas, multiple desserts, and the prix fixe brunch. Everything has been great. I don't think you can go wrong with the food. And, definitely get a dessert. The desserts have all been wonderful. 

The service is also great and the decor is pretty. The patio is always warm on the winter and it feels more spacious than it does inside. Casbah is one of the restaurants on my ""definitely check it out"" list.",0,2SwC8wqpZC4B9iFVTgYT9A,0,5,2016-01-23,review,1
noTnJ4m_8iLZdrgA_hYlfg,K17etnwAnVEYtdaydEttLA,"AMAZING! We heard Casbah had the best Calamari in Pittsburgh so we just had to try. So when we made a trip to Pittsburg in late summer this was one of our first stops. Had the calamari, and it was OUTSTANDING! Its nice and crisp and has that crunchy but not overpowering outer fryer coating, and then it had this lemon aoli that was under it. And just on the edges there was this sweet chili sauce with just enough spice, if you took up a piece, dipped it in the lemon, and then the chili, it was one of the best things I have ever eaten, and I have eaten some good stuff. After the calamari we chose their three course lunch meal for only $16. For $16 you get so much amazing food! It starts out with a cup of soup, I chose the squash purée, and oh my goodness was it good! It was this thick purée of butternut squash but it had toasted sesame on top and had some very developed rich flavors. After he soup I got half swordfish sandwich and again, AMAZING! I'm a sucker for swordfish so I may not be the most unbiased person, but it was soooo good! It had a nice medium rare swordfish steak on two nicely toasted pieces of homemade bread, and on top was clean and crisp vegetables to make the whole meal so light, and there was this dressing on it that words can't describe. My final course was the gnocchi, and I was literally speechless after just one bit of this heavenly gnocchi. I mean I have been talking this place up, but this gnocchi was to die for. I literally told the waitress, I would die for just one more bite. It was like little pillows of goodness in this rich sauce with shagbark hickory nuts and hen of the woods mushrooms. The strong flavor of the hickory nuts and the woods mushrooms compliments the softness of the gnocchi perfectly! Oh, and it had rich duck configue in it and the nice meaty duck left you feeling full afterwards. Overall, amazing restaurant, I have been back 2 times since then and have been astounded by their food every time. I highly recommend this to anyone with $16 and a tongue.",0,2SwC8wqpZC4B9iFVTgYT9A,0,5,2016-01-26,review,0

And bonus, while located in busy and crowded Shadyside, they have free valet parking.  So no complaining about finding a spot to park.

The set up is neat.  There is a very large front patio that is covered (and heated in the winter) that provides a nice California-esq ambiance.  

So many great choices for brunch that begin with a basket of delicious muffins, scones and breads.  

You have to choose the pre-fix if you're going to have a Bloody Mary or mimosa, because that is by far the best deal.  Or, you can just order your entree and still get a fair deal.  I had the eggs Benedict, which is basically perfect.

We went early so there wasn't much of a crowd. But the complimentary Valet service was still a plus in the below-zero weather. The service was attentive. Prices are not cheap but it was worth it. Portion sizes are reasonable. 

We started out with the cheese plate appetizer. But honestly, the complimentary bread with salted butter and soft, house-made goat cheese was delicious -- better than the cheese plate. They offered apple butter, fig spread and some type of compote to accompany the cheeses. 

For entrees, we got the Strozzapretti and the Long Island Duck. I'm a vegetarian and the waiter recommended the strozzapretti pasta, which was amazing. My taste buds were spoiled for the rest of the night. It was dressed in a flavorful, parmesan butter sauce. The only complaint I had was that the ricotta was too mild for the dish so I added some of the goat cheese that came with the free bread. My BF was pleased with his meal and but gave it 4/5 stars. 

All the desserts looked great. We chose the milk sponge cake with mascarpone cream and ice cream. The sponge texture was a little too hard, but the other components were excellent.

L4KA449E7wOf1YcRbWzc1g,nJAUa-sj-Q70nx_wjpGidA,"Casbah was alright, but nothing really popped. Had the bruchetta which was a overly creamy and sweet, without enough of an acidic element to cut through the creaminess. The tuna tartare was acceptable rather one note, tuna itself was too unimpressive on its own for such an unadulterated plating. the goats milk gnutti were legitimately good, the best part of the meal really, had a lot of flavors playing off each other very well. The scallop/crab pasta entree was good, but the noodles in mine were a bit more toothsome than al dente. The sauce was lacking depth of flavor. The scallops were very well cooked, but they were just good scallops, just what any chef should be able to do really. The Chilean seabass was not anything special, sauce lacked depth. The vegetable salad with it was neat, especially the radishes, which lost their strong peppery element in a good way. 

In all, Casbah was a disappointment. Its a high dining Mediterranean place, but accomplishes neither very well. If I really hadn't been exposed to some of the good places to eat in Pittsburgh and elsewhere, I might be more impressed. But alas, my standards are admittedly high. But honestly, for the money, there are better places to go.

Also, if the owner happens to read this, your gas radiant heaters in the front dining area are ducted wrong. Your air intake is pulling from the dining area, which creates a cold draft coming from the outside walls/windows. You need to have someone duct your intake air to the outside to prevent this, it will make the room much more comfortable and save you money on heating.",1,2SwC8wqpZC4B9iFVTgYT9A,0,3,2016-02-26,review,1

Last night I arrived to Casbah around 9:15. The kitchen closes at 10:00 so we were fine. The male at the host stand seemed pretty irritated that we were just arriving but it wasn't like I was walking in at 9:55. We opted to sit inside because it was a little chilly. He the two of us down at a table against the wall in the very back. It was tiny and cramped and not too mention very poor lighting. Almost felt like I was punished to that table? So I asked our server to be moved to another table in the restaurant. 

We served some bread and sea salt butter. In my opinion, the bread was nothing special. I had a few bites and didn't finish much just because I wanted to save room for the more important dishes. We were also served some type of Greek yogurt for the bread but that combination didn't sound appetizing to me. 

I ordered a 3 cheese selection option as an appetizer. I regret it a little bit now just because I was served the same bread. I added the prosciutto for an extra $4 and it was very good. I picked the first 3 cheeses on the menu (forget exactly what they were). I would have like the server to tell me which cheese was which, but I enjoyed them nonetheless. 

In addition I also had the Charred Spanish rock octopus which was the highlight of the entire meal. I highly recommend it. 

I had the Casbah (signature, as I was told) double-cut pork chop. This cut was very large and I ended up taking most of it to go. The rice was phenomenal, especially the rice that was under the meat. It had absorbed the flavors from the meat. 

Finally, I decided on the pistachio cannoli. I had a tough time deciding between that and the chocolate pot de creme. The flavor seemed to be a little off and I think i would have like the filling to be a bit sweeter.  I also opted for the Greek dessert wine pairing, which they only able to serve me half a glass because they ran out. It ended up being free, so I didn't mind. 

My server was very knowledgeable about the menu and was able to explain things very clearly. However, I HATE when servers go take a smoke break and then leave my table smelling like an ashtray. Off putting as I was eating my cannoli dessert.

The quality is more uneven than the restaurant dinning experience.  The crab cake sandwich was excellent, the roast turkey sandwich was dry and unfortunately I bit into a 2 inch long black plastic piece (I think it's the wrapping of the turkey, which the slicer just sliced right off, and it made it into the sandwich).

Cons: Not a convenient location for the car-less me, but well that's just me

Hi, I am a non-drinker and rarely have I found an establishment with an extensive list of non-alcoholic drinks.  Granted, Quiet Storm like many Pittsburgh places doesn't have an alcohol license and has to make do.  Ginger lemonade?  Yes.  All these other things from the soda fountain that are adult like enough for me?  Yeah!

I do love my meat, but found the vegan food here pretty good (albeit dry but I attribute that to my love of meaty things).  They used to have a prixe fixe meal on the weekends, but I think they got rid of that due to a low turnout.  Too bad most of Pittsburgh doesn't really learn to love culture.

Usually good music acts here.  Although the few times I was here, there was barely anybody else there besides the group I dragged along and the band's friends.  Usually 2-3 acts play.  Live.  And it's nice that there aren't many of us because we can sit up close.  And be sure to kick the friend who thinks it's ok to talk over the music.  

The bathroom also has a decor to match the style of the coffeehouse.

I have never been here during the daytime so I can't comment on that.  Always great service when we came here for dinner and the music (since we were basically the only ones there).

Those two facts have nothing to do with each other--the period in question was close to the end of the first semester of my (super-)senior year, when my friends and I would stay in our studios all night working, haul ass out to Quiet Storm for ambrosia-caliber restorative tofu scramble and coffee, and go back to school bright-eyed and bushy-tailed for another day of class.  And then usually I'd take a three-hour nap after the first class.  But I'm sorry, what is it I'm reviewing here?

The Quiet Storm has absolutely the best tofu scramble I've ever had.  I'm an accomplished vegan eater (I get stuff in my mouth first try nine times out of ten), I've had the best scrambles New York and San Francisco have to offer.  Believe you me, Quiet Storm tops them all.  I wish I knew their secret recipe, but the part I do know--baking the tofu rather than just sauteeing it--makes a tremendous difference.  Come in on a lazy Sunday morning, get the Nothin' Fancy, and you will see for yourself just how good tofu can be.  On top of that, they are as vegan-friendly as can be, with earth balance for the toast; soy, rice, and almond milks; and a selection of specifically vegan mixed drinks and milkshakes.  Plus, sandwiches!  Get the spicy spinach and peanut butter wrap, ask for added tofu (planks not crumble), and be astonished yet again.

AND AND, as a delicious cherry on top, they have theme brunches, fantastic theme brunches that show off the creativity and chops of the cooks here in a way that the regular menu can only hint at.

Anyway, the food here is pretty good.  Sometimes it's better than others, though I think it depends on the cooks.  I'm one of those vegetarians who doesn't much care about reducing kilocalories (the point of eating is to fuel our bodies, right?), so I like the cooks who pile on the mayo and cheese.  I'm sure the cooks who skimp on fattening ingredients have their fan base, too.  The menu is creative, and it feels like the people who make the food are trying to test their cooking chops, which I appreciate.

Hipsters abound (pro or con, depending on who you are) and the place is REALLY child friendly (again, could be a pro or con). But generally, the crowd is mellow, reading, chatting, just enjoying.

The menu is designed in a way that they have something for everyone (except those adverse to eating healthy :). Between the veg and vegan options, they manage to have a menu that is fairly celiac friendly too, not an easy thing to do!

A lot of the reviews here are about breakfast, which is amazing. But my favorite are their dinner salads. They're protein heavy, with a huge variety of ingredients, not your typical salads. And their specials, like tofu curry, are amazing, and always enough food for two.

Okay I won't change my rating, but I take back what I said about the food. They have changed the menu and it is really bad. 

We had Buffalo Tofu sticks which were ridiculously dry. 

I had the Thai Peanut Tofu Wrap which tasted just like peanut butter. 

I don't understand the point of Mockamole? It's made with peas instead of avocado. 

How to describe the food... it's as if they took pictures of how food should look and made the food without thinking about how food should taste. Gee peas are green, just like avocados??

BnBVuJgAUMm6dZQlSba8dg,8KCWgK8WrfLC4OdrHDj1jg,"For solid veggie/vegan food in Pittsburgh's east end, the QS is a reliable meat-free choice. There are enough good options on the menu that a seasoned QS diner could guide a newbie past the landmines of total-miss dishes, in search of the greener pastures of the spicy peanut tofu wrap and other local faves. The scrambled tofu is a shining star. The kitchen often does remarkable things with potatoes. The salads go above and beyond to woo your heart, with way more toppings & stuff than any other salad I've eaten in Pittsburgh -- this includes salads served with French Fries! Nothing here is fried - even the ""fried"" foods are baked. Your arteries are grateful. The kitchen is unfortunately very inconsistent, and an attentive & caring cook is a very different experience here than the apathetic, distracted or exhausted cook. 

This used to be The Place to Brunch, and I'm sure it's still busy on the weekend mornings, but I had to quit when all these SUV families started monopolizing my fave tables -- apparently the QS made it into some kind of ""VISIT PENNSYLVANIA"" travel guide as a great brunch spot. I hate to be that ""I liked their old stuff better"" kind of a person, but, well... 

Don't be caught unawares- in my cashless world, dinner at the QS means making a special ATM run. 

The QS is super kid-friendly. Books, magazines, and children's toys accompany the wireless internet (which sometimes works, and sometimes doesnt, and no, the staff can't help you). The menu is kid-friendly, the staff is used to dealing with kids, and if you really hate children, you might not want to go there since their peals of laughter and joy might melt your wicked black heart. I wouldn't hesitate to take the 2 year olds or 12 year olds I know. 

The drip coffee is good and bottomless- soy creamer is available. The espresso drinks are really really hit or miss. You may have the tastiest drink you could imagine, or you might be left choking down a $5 drink made by someone who has never drank a cup of coffee. No liquor license but you can BYOB for a nominal charge. 

The service is sometimes swift, but more often lacking. I would never take a date here again --- getting the totally wrong order & waiting half an hour for it to be even acknowledged by the staff is an embarrassment when you tell your date the restaurant is one of your faves. Fortunately, if you are dating me, you probably aren't there for the dinner. 

If you have plenty of time to kill & self-esteem strong enough to weather the whithering glances of the hipper set of pgh's east end, this could be your new fave spot too.

There were plenty of menu options and it looks like this restaurant is really doing it's part to support the local community.

The tables and chairs seem odd and it took me a while to find a chair that was comfortable, but maybe this is by design.  I am not a coffee expert but i really enjoyed my several cups of decaf.  Anyhoo, to the food.  This place is vegetarian only.   I started with a Hummus plate, unlike most creamy hummuses this hummus was gritty as i could actually taste the chick peas with each bite.  The hummus was surrounded by fresh crisp cucumbers, carrots, celery, calamata olives (big fan) and pita. Perfect starter.  For my main entree i ordered the curry special.  Do not expect an Indian food experience but this will not disappoint.   Everything was in the bowl, chick peas, basmanti rice, carrots, and other miscellaneous items.

Tofu wings appetizer was simply not very good; and I usually love these things! I tried the gyro wrap which was also a big disappointment. As far as I know, gyros are supposed to be pretty meaty, but this was mostly lettuce with sporadic chunks of seitan and cucumber,along  with dreaded diced unripe tomato. The wrap was dry and upon looking at the menu again, I see that the sauce that it probably requires costs an extra $.50. The tortilla itself was very white and seemingly unnatural compared to those found at most veggie establishments. My beverage was good and affordable--ginger lemonade. It was sweet for my tastes, but I am sure most people would have thought it perfect. I'll keep Quiet Storm in mind as a coffee shop, only.

F.Y.I after splitting the cost of the appetizer with a friend, my lunch cost me $17--ouch! I did have half of the wrap leftover and ate it later as a salad with my own dressing.

The drink options were pretty great- the coffee was just fine, but the ginger lemonade I ordered a couple hours after lunch was phenomenal. I wish I could have that more often. The food was great; there are lots of options and the portion sizes were exactly what I wanted. I had the Dagwood sandwich, which was a perfect mix of sweet, sour, and spicy with hummus, apples, hot peppers, cucumbers, and pickles... it came with an option of the side, and I had to try the mockamole. A big fan of guacamole myself, I was totally in doubt of a green pea-based mock version. I also really like peas, though, so I was open. And somehow they managed to make it work, and it really did taste very much like guac, with a slightly less heavy and maybe a bit grainier texture. But definitely worth a try. My friend had a wrap with curry and tofu and I honestly don't remember what else, but it was huge and really tasty. She chose the potato salad as her side, and it was the perfect imitation of German potato salad, so I was pretty happy.

The layout is unique, with the island, counter, and bar stools in the center and plenty of tables all around. It really provides a lot of opportunities for unique corners to sit in alone and lots of space for groups.

The coffee is decent. It's made from Dean's Beans, decent fair-trade coffee and brewed to a consistent perfection. i can't speak to lattes and espressos because i've never tried them, even though QS supposedly just got in a new espresso machine.

The Low Country grits were creamy and also enjoyable, but not too flavorful.  I didn't really taste the fakin' bacon or the garlic supposedly in the dish.  I'm not surprised though,  since a lot of vegetarian places seem to go light on the seasoning.  Definitely ask for cheddar with your grits if you eat dairy.  The three kinds of hot sauce on the table also help perk things up.

No complaints about the service, but they use some sort of chemical cleaner (for the floors or to wipe down the tables, maybe?) that's unpleasant-smelling.  I noticed it less the longer we stayed, maybe because I got food in front of me, but one would hope that a vegetarian establishment might opt for more environmentally friendly and less noxious cleaners.

You may get lucky and find yourself faced with an awesome rendering of a fabulously-designed vegetarian sandwich. In my experience, however (considering the 30+ Cubanos I've eaten there), you're more likely to get a sad, mediocre rendition.

Consistency is not their strong point.

Add to that the likelihood that you may be dosed with some surly owner attitude, and I've decided to steer clear.

It's a shame that I no longer feel it's worth it to chase the beautiful dream of my first meals at Quiet Storm. It's also a shame that many of their staff are wonderful, friendly, and helpful, and yet their efforts are overshadowed.

Example: I ordered the spicy peanut wrap for the first time and fell in love with it. I came back a couple weeks later, and it was bland and unappetizing. Maybe there is someone who works in the kitchen who doesn't know where the spice rack is-- I don't know.

The 'waitstaff' is hit-or-miss, too. Sometimes, they're great. Other times, I've waited for ages just for a menu. One guy actually snapped at me for asking for a breakfast item at lunch. 

That said, there are some good dishes, like the Black & Gold. I like that in some dishes you can replace rice with salad. A lot of people I've eaten with here have raved about the quesadillas. There's a nice laid back atmosphere and fun retro diner decor. There's also an extensive (but expensive) drinks menu with milkshakes, teas and coffee drinks, and a nice selection of locally-made vegan sweets and pastries.

My dinner here consisted of an apple panini and a ""shampoo"", a strange (but delicious!) cherry and almond cream soda. It very well might have taken me 20 minutes or more simply to decide on my beverage of choice - their list was not only long, but offered more innovative choices than I could have ever dreamt up. Among them, an impressive array of Italian sodas (lavender & lemon, mango & lime, white choc & mint, etc.), an enticing selection of lemonades (ginger lemonade, lavender lemonade), and some excellent-sounding tea combinations. To top it off, almost all flavors were available in the form of vegan milkshakes. How they concocted all of these culinary ideas is absolutely beyond me. (I apologize to the coffee drinkers. As a tea drinker myself, I hardly paid attention to that half of the menu.)

The apple panini I ordered came out quickly and was complemented with a side of tortilla chips and salsa. My panini included granny smith apples, apple butter, sharp cheddar, cream cheese, and seisage (vegetarian sausage) atop sun-dried tomato bread (though it seemed more like raisin to me). Never in a million years would I have come up with this strange combination of flavors, but it definitely worked. As described in the menu, indeed it was ""highly addictive"".

Table service was great, nothing took too long and it seemed pleasant and casual. No overbearing waiters, no frills, etc.

For vegetarian food in Pittsburgh, I say this place is aces. But compared to the many other veggie restaurants I've been to in this past, this place is average. It's really hit and miss with their dishes. When at a veggie place, I usually try to change it up each time I go to keep my diet varied. This has proven to be a little difficult at Quiet Storm because it seems every other time I get something I don't like. Apple Panini is amazing. Nachos are great! Curry wasn't spicy enough. Grits runny. Milkshakes YUM! I feel like the cooks don't have a good handle on cooking tofu there. Different dishes require tofu to be cooked for different lengths of time and it different sauces, and it has always tasted bizarre when I get it there. Sometimes its not pressed and cooked long enough. Sometimes its dried out! How can tofu get dried out? This is coming from someone who LOVES tofu. I can eat silken tofu straight out of the package with a little soy sauce and sugar.
If you have spent anytime in Portland, Oregon... the atmosphere in this place is very Portland. Outdoorsy hipster cafe style. It's loud, but I couldn't imagine it another way.

ONT1yy_-bbUTLk9XmB8sUQ,gLbUc95tm-bDuBFrSP9gDg,"I didn't realize that Quiet Storm was a completely vegetarian restaurant until I noticed the word ""seitan"" printed after every meat item on the menu. Normally I'd find this annoying, as I'm an unabashed and unapologetic meat eater. That doesn't mean I don't love a good veggie dish, but fake meat masquerading as real meat is one of my pet peeves. If you're going to serve vegetarian food, don't try to pretend it's anything else.

That grievance having been aired, I ordered the Blackadilla, a quesadilla boasting no false meat items, but stuffed with black beans, basmati rice, sweet potatoes, pineapple and cheddar cheese. It was delicious and filling, and at $8 for the enormous quesadilla and a small house salad, a pretty good deal. 

The menu at Quiet Storm is large, with breakfast and lunch/dinner items as well as an array of cafe drinks and desserts. In spite of the prevalence of seitan and tofu, there are a number of dishes that I look forward to sampling upon return.

And I do plan to return. As those of you who have read my other Yelp reviews know, the atmosphere of public places is very important to me, and the atmosphere at Quiet Storm does not disappoint. It's got a retro cool '50s diner vibe and a more modern but equally cool soundtrack that entices customers to stick around. The wait staff encourages this practice, giving diners plenty of space to hang out long after they've finished eating.

The one downside of Quiet Storm is its location, floating among gas stations and abandoned houses in Garfield, an area sandwiched between the more pedestrian friendly neighborhoods of Bloomfield and East Liberty, but not quickly accessible from either.

Well, for starters, the service. Our server was really nice, and had lots of reviews, suggestions and alternate ideas for what we should order... but the service was mind-numbingly, ridiculously slow-- and the place was half empty. Plus, even after two requests for napkins (which were not provided to begin with, and not available from other empty tables around us) we never received any napkins at all. I'm not really a messy eater, but come on!

Maybe part of the problem was expectations? We kicked things off with the ""firesticks"" appetizer-- some really tasty quesadilla-ish things. After that, our orders (I had the thai salad) were just kind of... boring? Strangely spiced? I feel like the bar was set high with the app, and then none of the entrees met the expectations of yummy veggie goodness, and my dining companions agreed. I also ordered a cup of the mac & cheese, and it was awful. You know how when you reheat elbow mac & cheese in the microwave, and the cheese gets all greasy/gloopy and the noodles stick together? Well, it was exactly THAT, with some powdered garlic sprinked on top. Really. I should have made my own leftover mac at home and not paid $4 for a cup of that. Learn from my mistake.

We had planned to order milkshakes, too, but our server spent so much time in a black hole or something that by the time she finally returned, we'd been completely finished with our meal for at least 15 minutes.

That's an unpleasant prospect to face down after a hard night of drinking, which is the only time the idea of brunch ever occurs to me.  But then, the grim Spectre of Laziness appeared to me and asked, ""Do you really want to drive to another place?  Just look at you. Your wearing the same shirt that you wore yesterday dude.""  

The Spectre of Laziness is a dick, but he was also right.  And to my surprise, nothing I had was bad at all.  For brunch options, meat eaters will find that potatoes and eggs are the cornerstone of any breakfast, and seitan substitutions are not as bad as say, having the grim Spectre of Laziness point out your slovenly appearance.  

I think the biggest surprise in this place is that, though nothing is particularly jarring to the palate, there is nothing that really stands out as being amazing.  In Yelp terms: it's kind of a 3.  For hard core vegetarians having a night, er, mid-afternoon on the town, it's probably a blessed change from the meat based culture that Pittsburgh is pretty famous for.  But I'm willing to wager that very meat eaters will become converted to vegetarians after this.  Maybe they did TOO good of a job substituting meat items.

Anyway. I have returned now in 2011 for a veg brunch, and it was a pleasant, if not-so-good-value-for-money experience. I got the True Grits (yeah, Jeff Bridges, yeah), which was a HUGE bowl of grits (some shaved, grocery store-feeling cheddar on top), a pile of delicious, chopped lemony kale, some pretty blah scrambled eggs and a large glass of cranberry juice (very healthy!). Overall, it was fine. I didn't like the $12 price tag so much (seriously, grits is pioneer food and you're charging me $12!), nor did I dig the shades of hipper-than-thou among the clientele, but shrug shrug.",0,PzG0XmAmtXFs6Fdnubf41g,0,4,2011-10-16,review,0

I had 3 orders in 2 days, and since it's tofu & not some greasy wings... it's a legitimately healthy meal/snack.
The Cheesy Snake -- a vegetarian cheese steak -- can be made with vegan cheese, and it's pretty slammin, too.  
The slaw tastes like liking a brick of salt, and the coffee etiquette -- pouring old pots into other, half-full pots -- leaves a bit to be desired, but overall, I know that it's one of a few places in Pittsburgh that serves vegan food that's pretty awesome.",0,PzG0XmAmtXFs6Fdnubf41g,0,4,2011-10-28,review,1

I got the smashed potatoes with seitan, cheese, and aioli.  The first bite was OK--the aioli didn't quite suit my taste, but everything else worked pretty well together.  However, 20 some-odd bites in to the dish, the flavors were getting repetitive and the mushy texture started to gross me out.  I got about half-way through eating the dish and the so-so aioli became too much for me.  I couldn't take another bite.

However, my wife's apple panini was delicious.  I would probably eat a few of those if I came back.  The cream cheese, cinnamon (from the bread?), and apple all worked together in glorious harmony.

On a strange note, while we were eating, some camera guys came in and started setting up what looked to be an interview.  We asked the staff what was going on.  Apparently someone was filming their submission/application to be on a reality show.  ""Oh cool,"" we thought.  ""What reality show?"" we asked.  ""Not sure, something on the Golf Channel,"" they replied.  HAHAHAHA!  I thought watching grass growing on TV was boring enough.  Now they're making a reality show about it.

In the end,  the gross aioli was inexcusable to me.  Otherwise, I'd probably go 4 stars.   I still plan to come back and give it another shot.",0,PzG0XmAmtXFs6Fdnubf41g,1,3,2011-12-11,review,1

Unfortunately, the recent menu and more importantly price changes have made this go from a regular weekend brunch place to only a special-occasion place. The menu went from 2 pages to just 1 (still good food though - try the grits!) and the prices went up to $12-ish before tax.

But let me explain.  My friends and I wanted to try this place out and had high hopes.  I haven't heard of many vegetarian/vegan places in Pittsburgh so I expected to have some awesome vegetarian food.  However, from the get go, our host was absolutely terrible.  He did not look us in the eye and was just overall awkward.  There was obviously room in the restaurant for the four of us but he had to ""look in the back"" to see if there was room.  One of the other servers eventually sat us in a clearly empty table that we could have picked out for ourselves.  Our first host came back, reiterated the same thing the server told us, but never gave us menus.  I had to go out of my way to ask for menus about five or ten minutes after we had been seated.

To be fair, our assigned server was very nice.  She was friendly and approachable.  But of course, our food came and mine was cold.  The potatoes in the hash I ordered was stale, old and cold and had such a small accompanying serving of bread.  Also, our utensils weren't given to us until after our food was served.  I know I may be sounding like a little bit of a snob but utensils should be expected before the food arrives.  Not to be completely biased, the rest my party had decent food.  It just wasn't anything special.  Definitely not worth $12 for brunch.

I walked up to the bar and was just going to grab a seat there, but super hipster server guy asked me to take a table, because it had an outlet to plug my laptop in. I didn't need to, but  ... good lookin' out. 

Anyway, ordered my latte - good espresso, but pretty weak foam. Served in a pint glass. That's fine. 

Menu actually looked really good, so I went for a sammy with apples, seitan sausage crumbles, and cheese. They offer different sides, but my super hipster server guy didn't ask me what I wanted; so being a newbie I figured maybe that was only with certain menu items. I was wrong, when the guy taking care of the table behind me was asked what he wanted. My fault for not speaking up. Sandwich was good, not to die for though, and frankly kinda small for $8. 

I'll finish with this: Internets are free, right? So, where's the code? Did I need to ask??

We went this past weekend and had brunch. We each had thai coffee which was ok, not stupendous, not horrible. He ordered the veggie burger, and I had the chocolate oatmeal pancakes.

His burger was unseasoned and fairly cold, my pancakes were okay...but to be honest really lacked flavor (the taste of what I imagine cardboard to be came to mind).

I had high hopes for the tofu scramble, especially after seeing positive reviews about it. But honestly... It tasted like nothing. I thought it'd be moister with a creamy consistency that might come from silken tofu, but it was hard, dry, and chewy. Hubby got a country burrito that was much better in comparison to my plate... But that might have been due to the fact that his whole plate was doused in gravy. Anything will taste better drenched in gravy. We think the gravy tastes like the powdered packet kind where you just add water. On top of all this service wasn't the greatest. I had to fish around for my own ketchup and they didn't even bother to ask me what kind of toast (3 options on the menu)I wanted when I ordered the toast option for my meal. Then they didn't bother to ask hubby if he wanted anything to drink after he had picked one of the $12 entrees that come with coffee or juice. We had to tell someone else to get it for us. Also they don't really wash their cups. There are 2 sink basins at the front where they just dunk the cups in one soapy basin then dunk the cups in a second water basin and then stack them next to the sink. It made me not want to drink my water even though I was thirsty. Good idea, but poorly executed food.

In that it does some things right, but none of the important things.  It has a decent sized shop with large windows and its bright, so that's good.  They have good music, but unfortunately we were seated right below one of what looked like two speakers in the place.  Its a large restaurant so in order to make it the right volume for people far away from the speaker it has to be too loud for the people close to the speaker.  I know the trade-offs of sound systems all too well.  If only there was a way to solve this problem like... just riffing here... more speakers at a lower volume?

They had a greatest hits of the thrift store type of decor and the standard shitty artists selling their paintings like at every coffee house you've ever been to.  They include coffee/tea/juice/whatever in the price of the brunch because, like everyone, I hate choices too and I definitely wanted at least one of those.  I'm looking at the menu and its a vegan/veggie place so we're never going to be good friends but I'd like to think that there's something that looks halfway decent but it all looks awful.  There are two Tex-Mex-Ranchero breakfast dishes... that's at least one too many; and there's only like eight choices which sounds like plenty as a number but I assure you it was not enough here.

I go with the Egg Frittata as my least bad option and it ends up tasting mostly flavorless but with a distinct stale note.  It comes with a salad that is not bad, but who wants a salad for breakfast.  As we're leaving the waiter, who's been fine the whole time, asks us where we're from and my girlfriend answers ""D.C.""  The waiter replies, ""Oh, I'm sorry about that.""  Now, neither of us is actually born in the D.C. area, nor do I even particularly like living there.  So I'm not personally offended, but I'm not sure if someone from or living in Pittsburgh has solid footing to talk the business about Washington D.C. or almost any other large city.  Its not like property values in Pittsburgh are indicating that everyone's clammoring to live there, whereas in Washington D.C., they are.

Anyhoo.  Really pleasantly surprised with this joint, and the food was pretty reasonably priced.

I also enjoy the tahini queso, I often add it to my burrito. It's best on the nachos. For around $13 you can get a delicious filling breakfast/brunch coffee/tea included. They also have great pastries & dairy free coffee drinks & milkshakes! It's a vegan dream come true. It does get a little crowded during Saturday mornings so expect a wait, but completely worth it. The atmosphere is oozing with hipster ambiance associated with the area (Garfield) which also means they often play good music! Last time I was there it was all Neil Young!

It had an unexpected texture but I still quite enjoyed it. For my entrée I had the Spinach Burger, which was quite filling. It is quite unique and comes with plenty of options for toppings. I couldn't resist putting cheese on the otherwise vegan burger, but still felt very healthy eating such a veggie-filled dinner! Their milkshakes also looked amazing - I would have tried one but I needed something to warm me up instead so I got a latte, which was also very good. One other thing I thought was neat was that the sell mixers and encourage you to bring your own champagne and/or vodka. I haven't seen that before, but it's a great idea!

7zpDhrRZRTGCkAh3SHbEww,ZKyKNzCtPRzp-iaLqbKa6w,"I'll be honest, this wasn't our first, second or even third option for breakfast, but when it came to early Sunday grubbing with a group of six, this was pretty much the only place didn't have a two-day long wait. 

In fact, there was no wait at all when the six of us popped in a little after noon on the weekend. Odd, but my group was hungry so we didn't question the kismet. 

The restaurant is pretty enormous as far as cafes go, and it's nice because they don't pack the tables on top of each other so you're never going to be crammed next to a crying baby or having to scoot your chair in every time the table next to you needs a coffee refill. The furnishings all appear to be second hand finds as well as local art and LOTS of owl statues. It's a hoot, for sure. 

One weird thing is the one bathroom with the sink outside, so if you're sitting in the back you can heavily monitor who comes out and doesn't wash their poopy hands. On the other hand, if you go to the bathroom here you'll likely feel like you have to make your hand washing some sort of big production so the other people in the back will take notice of your exceptional hygiene habits.

I was feeling pretty sick still and actually brain washed myself  into believing that my weekend bug was actually morning sickness so on top of already feeling super nauseous and not hungry, and naturally my non-motherly instincts wanted to starve whatever demon might be brewing inside me but the hypothetical baby's daddy insisted I eat something and took it upon himself to order me the tofu scramble, which I was sort of excited to try despite feeling otherwise very green. It was actually very bland and dry and even though I think it was only like $3, I think I would have rather had the $3 in my pocket than the scramble so I took a few bites and then pawned it off on the boo who insisted I try his veggie breakfast burrito. The burrito was the total opposite of the scramble- absolutely outstanding and even though it was the size of a guinea pig, I think I could have downed the whole thing (of course, I would have blamed it on my imaginary incubating child and said I was eating for two). 

Going around the table, everyone seemed content with their food, besides the grits order that were decidedly bland, but that's kind of how I've come to think of grits in general. Our service was great and though most of the table's food was just okay, that burrito, the owl statues and the house horchata I ordered as my beverage really made the experience for me. I guess what I'm trying to say is that I can understand the 3-star average on Yelp, but that I think you can totally come here and have a 4 or even 5 star time if you order wisely. Just remember: Burrito, horchata and time the bathroom-goers for extra entertainment. 

PS- I'm so NOT pregnant (in fact, can someone get me a heat pack a few dozen Midol?), but thanks for your concern.",9,PzG0XmAmtXFs6Fdnubf41g,10,4,2012-12-13,review,9

Nice layout with tables along the windows and more in back. If you're not familiar with this kind of scene it could seem a little rundown, but to my eyes it was fine. Really, it's kind of the proto-typical East Coast college town vegetarian hangout.

A small disclaimer: I am not vegan or vegetarian and I never will be. I love meat. But I also love vegetables and fruits and pretty much the entire food pyramid. And these things can be combined to make tasty vegan food. But ""Texturized vegetable protein hydrated with seasonings"" is not food to me. Yep, that description of their ""chorizo"" comes directly off their menu. Eating vegetarian does NOT mean you need to subject yourself to these highly processed ""foods.""

Less processed substitutes like tofu, tempeh, and seitan are used as well, but they are mostly treated as a stand-in for meat. I guess if you are a vegetarian that misses eating meat, this may satisfy you. However, as an omnivore, why would I eat a faux-BLT when I can eat a real one? How about instead of trying to imitate the flavor and texture of meat, we actually come up with creative combinations of vegetables, fruits, and legumes that are delicious in their own right. What a concept! Have you ever eaten a vegetarian dish and thought, ""Whoa, I can't believe I actually like this better than meat""? I have! But don't expect that feeling here. It will be more like: ""Umm...I guess tofu mixed with nutritional yeast is kinda reminiscent of scrambled eggs?""

I have the excitement of the little girl on Despicable Me ""It's So FLUFFYYYY!"" 

My excitement aside, the menu was pretty large for all veg food. They have breakfast all day, which is always ok with me. Prices were average (~8.50), and portions were large enough to provide lunch for the next day. (Although I have heard that the Cuban Sandwich is on the small side).

I had the Banh Mi, which was fabulous. The bread was fresh, aioli was nice, vegs were pickled just right, but the tofu was a little on the dry side (on next day lunch reheat it was perfect). I was surprised by the veg seisage. It was really good. 

Gazpacho was nice, although I am not really a fan of cold soup. It reminded me of a smoother salsa. Good, but just not my thing.

Sarah S. had the special, home fries with chili and cheese.  This was on the spicy side (a good thing) and came with tortilla chips. She was happy with it.

I'm all about veg/vegan restaurants, but I have to agree with other reviewers who wish Quiet Storm's food was *slightly* more interesting.  

Husband and I ordered take-out so we could enjoy a late lunch al fresco at Schenley Park overlook.  Folks working were vegan-hipster quirky, but friendly and helpful.  We ended up waiting about 30 minutes for our food, so we decided to partake in an afternoon coffee to pass the time.  I  had an iced Morroccan latté with cardamom and rose,  husband the Mandorla sweet almond milk latté.  Both were excellent.

For my meal I picked the Tahini Bowl with brown rice, spinach, roasted red pepper, tomatoes, pepitas and fried tofu cutlet with a tahini dressing.  I wished there had been less rice and more dressing; the bowl was also screaming for more seasoning.  Husband opted for the Crunch Wrap Extreme: scrambled tofu tossed with celery, carrots, edamame, kale and spinach, dressed with vegan wasabi mayo.  Again, twice as much dressing would have added flavor and moisture to an otherwise fine wrap.

And that's just it: the food at Quiet Storm is fine.  When really, I'd been hoping to be utterly wowed by the magic capable of being worked by nothing more than mere vegetables, plain grains and humble legumes.

We had the ""tenders"" appetizer, with both the vegan BBQ sauce and the vegan wasabi mayonnaise. We much preferred the BBQ sauce, but I am guessing if you are a wasabi fan, you would like that too. We all thought it was wonderful. On the advice of the server, I had the peanut wrap. It was spicy, heavily peanut-flavored, but full of yummy veggies. I also had a side of chili, that I liked a lot (and I make my own veggie chili at home, so I am picky). Ben had the apple panini with the gazpacho side. We both thought the gazpacho was kind of plain (it got better by adding chili!), but the apple panini (with ""seisage"", cheese, etc.) was very good.

The buildings surrounding Quiet Storm are often painted with cute art or have little interesting things about them. I love this neighborhood, but I love Quiet Storm even more! 

I've only been here twice, and I always want to go more often but somehow it doesn't happen. I've turned on three of my friends to Quiet Storm too, and they love it just as much. The first time I visited I ordered a tofu hash. It was an amazing blend of seasonal vegetables, including some I would never eat otherwise. The tofu was nice and firm, the seisage was spicy and perfectly chewy. The vegan ""cheese"" sauce was also rich and delicious.  The portion was so huge, I couldn't finish it. Leftovers are rarely as good as when the meal is fresh, but I was pleasantly surprised to find that my leftovers were even BETTER than the fresh meal. I think this is because the spices and vegetables had more time to meld together in a perfect veggie harmony. 

The second time I visited was 4/21/2013. A group of my friends came here for Brunch. Two of us ordered the Vegan Country Burrito, another friend ordered the french toast with pistachio honey topping and my other friend ordered a tofu hash with black beans and salsa. Everything was generously portioned, but some meal choices were sold out. They were a bit disappointed that there was no more falafel. All of us devoured our plates and happily chattered about the complexity of flavor, protein content in vegan food items and how much we loved the atmosphere. 

Quiet Storm is a great little place to visit. It's never lacking in interesting things to look at while you eat. Food comes as quickly as possible. There are plenty of options to please everyone, and if you think you don't like vegetables, try one of their plates and you may change your mind.

Tip: If you want to go for Sunday brunch, go early so your favorites will still be available.

1. The Vegan / Hipster / Metal thing has got to go. All I kept on seeing through the kitchen window was the armpit hair of the cook wearing the Motörhead tank top. I am a huge Motörhead fan, but when I go to an overpriced restaurant I don't want Lemmy to be making my food.
 
2. The food is bland. Shoving a bunch of brown rice and black beans in a tortilla does not automatically make the food vegan and there were very few things on the menu that were 100% vegan.
 
3. The service was pretty bad. Our appetizer came to the table with our main dish and the entire time we watched the staff eat their dinner in front of everyone at the counter. I am pretty sure that three different cooks made our order, as the cooks were tag teaming the line while they were eating.
 
4. Last, but not least... the volume level in the place was numbing. The guy working the counter kept on slamming the ice cream freezer door every time he made a milkshake, the music was some sort of Bjork style electronica that I am pretty sure was written to induce migraines and there were about 6 hippy couples letting their kids run wild.

I also ordered the Sesame Noodle Platter (noodles, soy, tofu, red cabbage, mushrooms, broccoli, onions, peppers) with a ginger carrot salad. It was a solid meal.

One thing about Pitt pizza... it is slightly different than true NYC style:  the crust is not as thin and there's a whole lot more cheese.  As a rule Pitt pizza also has a slightly sweeter tomato sauce.  The sum of its parts is still a delicious close cousin to NYC pizza.

The pizza I tried in Pitt in my order of favorites:
Fiori's
Pizza Sola (Penn Circle Branch)
Pizza Perfectta
Aiello's (Murray Street)
Beto's

Save for Beto's, I thought they were all delicious.  Wish I had a chance to try Mineo's.  A Pittsburgh native friend of mine calls this his favorite but they were closed July 5th when I went by their place on Murray... I'll try them next time I'm in the 'burgh.

Okay, not the worst pizza ever, but it's pretty far down my list of pizzerias...and that's sad, considering I quite literally live across the street from it. This should be my go-to pizza destination but I'd rather pay a delivery charge than eat their pizza. The sauce is way too sweet (like, Papa Johns sweet) and there isn't enough cheese. There are too many decent pizza delivery places around to settle for this. The only thing I enjoy about Pizza Perfectta is that their sign hilariously claims, ""Excitingly flavored!"" Personally, I wasn't having an orgasm over my mediocre pizza. Maybe if they wouldn't have tempted me with such language I would be less pissed off at them. Two stars only because they let me borrow some paper cups when I moved into my apartment and hadn't unpacked my kitchen stuff yet. Without them I may have had to travel half a block north and grab some from a different restaurant. Thanks, Pizza Perfectta.

 I was so full after man-handling my second piece of pizza I had to stop eating. But my friend had a half finished piece of Greco just sitting there on the table waiting for me to finish it.

I had noticed this pizza place before and had wanted to try it but never really had the chance before today.  Inside it looked like your normal pizzeria with a counter to order from, a pop cooler, a display dessert case and a pinball machine which was sadly not on. The temperature inside was pleasant as the air conditioner was set to 66 which was a good change from the stickiness outside.  We were greeted almost immediately on entering and I ordered a plain slice.  A few minutes later we were on our way with my slice of pizza.  I was happy to feel that the box was actually hot and so the slice was properly warmed.  Upon opening it I was also pleased to see that the slice was pretty large.  The pizza itself ended up being really solid.  On it there was a good covering of good tasting cheese which did not fall off the pizza when eating.  The crust was crispy and of medium thickness which meant the slice wasn't floppy.  Finally my favorite part was the sauce which had some good flavor to it.  As a matter of a fact you could see the spices when looking at it closely.

After ordering pizza at home twice that week (we DID NOT feel like cooking), I decided to go with a grilled chicken salad. Meh. I'm not saying it was bad, but it wasn't really that great either. I thought they could have dressed it up some more. It was loaded with (too much) cheese and it melted due to the fries being warm, making the top of the salad kind of gross. Underneath the melted cheese was the lettuce, tomatoes, onions and cucumber. I guess this is all standard for a salad, but it really just didn't impress me. Plus, I thought the chicken tasted pre-cooked which should be a big no-no for restaurants. One perk, however, was the size as it was pretty big! However, for $8.00, I felt it was a little steep.

Everything started fine with our order of 24 wings with three separate sauces for 3 eaters. The wings arrived exactly an hour later with the exact number of wings promised and a side of celery. Here's the catch...THERE WAS NO SAUCE! My party of three decided to just tough it out and eat the wings plain. They were, I kid you not, so bland that I wasn't sure what I was eating. They literally just threw the wings in the fryer and delivered it to us. So once we realized how unbearable the plain wings were, we called and complained about the sauce. About 40 minutes later, the sauce arrived. At this point, the wings got cold and our hunger turned into an unbearable rage. We tried BBQ, Garlic Parmesan and Spicy. The sauces were just average. The spicy sauce was so weak that I should've just settled with a bottle of sirracha. 

The deliver guy gave us a cannoli as an apology....ONE CANNOLI....3 eaters! You get the point. But this gives me the chance to tell you how terrible the cannoli was. The outer shell was soggy and the filling made me gag a little. It looked nice, but didn't taste that great. 

So after 1 hour and 40 minutes, 24 wings, 3 sauces and a cannoli... we have 3 very unhappy customers. The wings were the most mediocre wings I have ever tasted. I will NOT order here again for the wings NOR will I recommend it to the fellow wings connoisseurs out there.

We picked up the pizza at exactly fifteen minutes.  It clearly had been sitting for a bit because it was already cold by the time we got home.  The pizza was just OK.  There was plenty of pepperoni but practically no cheese.  The crust was decent, but it just wasn't a memorable pizza.

Overall, I found their pies typical of PGH pizza in style, and slightly above average in quality, hence the 4 star rating (my average rating, as well as the PGH Yelp citywide average, is 3.5).

Jason F. describes the elements of the pizza well, so I won't reiterate them.  I will mention that there was a generous amount of cheese, and the sauce:cheese ratio was on point.  I don't recall the crust being particularly crisp (my personal sticking point when it comes to pizza); however, on the other hand, I don't recall it being floppy or insubstantial, either.

In terms of overall quality, Pizza Perfectta's pies are a cut above those of nearby Pizza Parma, and they offer similar conveniences (acceptance of credit cards; delivery).

The sauce that Pizza Perfectta used for their pizza had enough of a kick so that it brought out the cheese and other flavors of my pizza (mushrooms, onions, and sausage).

When I ordered my pizza from them, they were ridiculously fast about getting it ready and it only took 15 minutes for me to wait to get my pizza from them.

The wait times are very short (I don't think we have ever waited more than 10 minutes), and we have never had a problem getting an appointment quickly. They have two offices right next to each other - one for routine exams and vaccines and the other for more involved exams/illnesses which I think greatly helps reduce the wait time and makes it easier to get an appointment quickly.

I love that they talk to my guys while they are examining them and give them lots of pets and love before they have to poke them. 
They will also take time to answer your questions and provide you with the most up to date information regarding vaccines, meds and treatments. 
Sadly Darger will be going in for his last visit in the next week or so (cancer), and we have been working mostly with Dr. Simard and Dr. Schroth leading up to these final days.

-tEbGfPj1aeG0q8-XJLK-w,tCKfjVwDTy9NDOgqCg_P4Q,"To be fair, this place deserves a 5 star review if it were for their veterinary care alone. They are highly knowledgeable and gave my pet nothing but the best while we were there. They also provide pheromone bandanas for the pets to help ease their anxiety while you wait, which I found extremely helpful.

However, I was unable to be a loyal customer to this clinic as they were not loyal to me. It seemed every time I needed an appointment, they were fully booked for the next 2, sometimes 3 weeks. While I understand planning ahead for routine care like vaccines can be planned ahead, if my dog is experiencing an acute problem such as vomiting/diarrhea for a couple of days it's not worth anything if she can't be seen within a day or two. Their earliest appointment on that occasion was 1.5 weeks out. While this was frustrating and I was ready to switch vets, they redeemed themselves and kept me as a customer for a bit longer. I took my dog to the humane society to save some money on her shots and she ended up getting pretty sick. She kept vomiting and was lethargic, didn't want to eat or drink. I called the vet at the first sign of lethargic, loss of eating and drinking. They told me to bring her right in, no appointment necessary. They saw her as soon as we walked in and got us squared away with the proper medications and what to do next time before her shots to prevent her getting so sick again. I do appreciate them for that as they went above and beyond in that situation.

The point at which I decided to transfer to another vet is when we adopted a 2nd puppy from St. Louis. We got her from a shelter and she came to us with one leg amputated (fresh incision) and she would cry out in pain any time she was lifted or touched even close to that area, she also had a lot of diarrhea. The shelter we got her from gives a 2 week health guarantee but given the issues we wanted to be seen that week. I called for an appointment and was told the earliest was 2.5 weeks out. I explained the situation regarding her health concerns as well as the fact that we needed her to be seen within 2 weeks and asked if there was anything I could do. The receptionist responded by telling me I might consider having her seen by another vet or the humane society for the first time, & then have her first puppy appointment with them to continue her care from there. I'm sorry but the purpose of having a vet is to have them as their primary doctor for health issues, so it's really a problem if we can't ever get an appointment and it's clear to me they don't want my dogs as their patients if they are suggesting for me to go somewhere else...but anyway I called the Big Easy in Lawrenceville right after I hung up since they couldn't even try to accommodate us, they got me in for a walk in appointment the same day and both of my dogs have been going there ever since.",0,0TvxDhCKPQ-_dDyffEnJQQ,0,2,2016-05-16,review,1
Hu8Z-rCM8aIiH6-tq7nwHA,2jLlSc2iKBOEc5fybPtd6Q,"I have been going here with three different animals. However, I recently missed an appointment. I called to reschedule and talk to their office manager, Barb. Barb told me that my phone was out of service when they called me the day before my appointment, but it was not because I use my phone for my full time career and I would be fired if my phone was off. I proceeded to tell her my phone number and she said that is the number that was out of service. She then proceeded to tell me that I was not allowed to reschedule since I missed my appointment. I then proceeded to tell her my father died about four months ago who was a long time customer of theirs with our previous dogs.

I am so disappointed in how I was treated by their office manager that I was in tears. I have been going to Dr. Gerson with my mom and my animals for my entire life. Some of my childhood memories are in that office with my favorite furry friends.

It is unfortunate that they have such a rude office manager. I have NEVER been treated so poorly by a human being in my entire life. From the moment I got on the phone with her, she was nothing but rude and unwilling to help me. Barb, if you are reading this, don't you think I have had enough for one year? You couldn't cut a long time customer a break? My dad will punish you from heaven for how you treated his daughter. Those doctors behind those doors have no idea how rude Barb is to their customers and it is not right because now I look down on a place that once was my animals second home.

I hope you replace Barb with a women with a heart. I now have to look for a new office because I am not allowed to go back because I accidentally got an appointment time mixed up. Karma is coming for you BARB! I",0,0TvxDhCKPQ-_dDyffEnJQQ,0,1,2016-06-22,review,0

Whoa, baby!  Do I have to upgrade this to a five-star review or what?!!  This place knows how to do a pastrami on rye right!  To start with, they use Boar's Head meats here, which are some of the best deli meats around.  Second of all, they size the sandwich just right.  It's not small, but it's not so ginormous that you can't finish it.  The meat is layered just perfectly on it and they don't slather on the condiments (presentation is every bit as good as taste, folks).  Third, the bread tastes like it was delivered just this morning.  Fourth, they top it off with a really good pickle.   Finally, when you bite into it, the sandwich doesn't overpower you--instead it melts delicately in your mouth.  M-m-m-m-m, you wanna savor it.  

Frick Park Market is much more than a deli though.  You can get convenience foods, milk, ice cream, etc, here.

Frick Park Market is a hidden gem tucked away in Point Breeze near one of the roundabouts and a few blocks from the park itself. They serve a variety of ice creams and snacks in addition to their house-made sandwiches. All of the lunchmeat is Boar's Head, which is a top of the line brand that tastes absolutely wonderful. You can pretty much customize your sandwich however you'd like or choose one from the pre-made menu board. Either way you'll end up with a treat! My one complaint is that I wish the bread was a wee bit sturdier...it gets soggy easily. It would be nice to see them using Trader Joe's quality bread that stands up to all the wonderful sandwich fillings a little better. Until then I'll continue to remake my leftover half a sandwich on fresh bread at home. It's a small price to pay for such a nice deli close to my favorite park in Pittsburgh.

I must say a word about the kind staff who work here as well. I purchased a ginger beer last time I stopped in, and it had a twist off cap. Those things suck to open with bare hands.

It's a bit too expensive for the average person, I think (and yes i understand that it's a co-op, etc. but it doesn't change that it's probably middle to upper class prices by comparison), but it does offer some deals. It's the best place to buy spices because they're sold in bulk, and if you want to try something new or only need a little for a recipe, you don't have to buy a whole bottle. There is an entire aisle of spices, spice blends and dried herbs, so there is a lot to choose from. It's also great to buy a little at a time because you can make sure your spices are always fresh. Same goes for the bulk food bins, though probably half of them are the 9,000 flavors of granola they stock.

The salad bar has great variety. The hot food bar, not so much. It runs out quickly, and it's too easy to run up a high tab if the good stuff is weighty. I'm not a fan of most of the packaged fresh food in the deli case. The stuffed grape leaves are not good, and a lot of the other things seem sort of bland to me.

On the other hand--if I lived on my own, I could do all my shopping here.  But, since I don't--I can't.  It's tough to stock a household kitchen solely from the EEFC--I mean, I can't really afford to regularly buy $15 laundry detergent.

Hot foods was bumpin' but I was still able to stroll around and decide on what Indian Kitchen cookery would go in the belly for dinner.

I randomly found out about East End when I was doing a search for organic, local food products. We decided to go check it out and instantly fell in love. Their produce selection is second-to-none, seriously. And yes, I am including Giant Eagle in that!

Seriously, just about every time we've gone all the produce looks so fresh and brightly colored (i.e., the peppers, tomatoes, fruits, etc.) and ripe. I also like how they carry pasta noodles, rice, and other fun things in bulk. We always lament about how since there's only the two of us, we don't always need the large offerings that you usually find at places like Giant Eagle. Being able to pick out just the amount you need and not letting anything go to waste makes me feel a lot better.

Beyond the food products, I have also gotten into making my own body washes. East End carries all of the ingredients that I need with multiple options. They have recently redone their store (and are still renovating) and have expanded their meat (they didn't use to carry meat at all) and cheese selections tremendously. The meat is a little pricey, actually the whole store is little pricey, but in my opinion it is well worth it. It's nice knowing that the items are organic and come from sustainable farms. Bonus: they buy as much locally produced items as they can as well. 

I really have nothing bad to say about them. The service has always been great and I love the selections and products offered. I can't comment on the cafe as I haven't eaten at it, but I hear the food is great. A combination of East End and the Strip has pretty much replaced Giant Eagle for me.

MQ1QmzOTZ6Ok1WLe3h_CQw,NrgFJ7dQJ9zSSbq8IQxzZg,"East End Food Co-op is awesome!

If I had to choose between the Co-op and WF, the Co-op is where it's at.

There is a good selection of fruits and veggies, as well as toiletries (shampoos, soaps, toothpaste, tampons, shaving creams, etc.) to household cleaning products. The frozen section is also very diverse with a good selection of frozen meals, ice cream (dairy and nondairy), and veggies. The Co-op also carries a nice selection of foods for people with restricted diets especially for Celiac and vegans, or for people with severe allergies like myself. 

They also carry hard to find vegan cheeses such as Treeline that I have difficulty finding at WF in Pittsburgh and the Co-op in West Virginia. I was also happy to find that they had my favorite Ito-En sencha green tea shot (it's just green tea in a can, it's not like one of those energy shots at all). 

The deli is also fantastic, and I highly recommend the Co-op deli over the WF deli. There are a wide variety of soups and salads and dressings. The vegan mushroom soup is really, really, really yummy. There are also vegan meals in ready to go containers (salads, vegan pesto noodle salad, etc.). You can also order coffee/espresso at the deli counter. As with any good Co-op, they have a variety of non-dairy milk options. 

If you have food allergies or have any dietary restrictions the Co-op is an excellent place to get a quick meal (hot or cold) and to pick up groceries. There is also a little dining/sitting area at the front of the store. It's kid friendly and they even have a little compost/recycling bin! Yes, this is important for me to mention because I come from Seattle where recycling is the norm and we get fined if we don't recycle..and recycling does not seem to be a big thing in WV where I currently live. 

There is also a community board if you are looking to post something up (events, classes, pet sitting, etc.) near the bathroom in the back of the store.",0,-iVcmhjfq79QoTWzrb6pKg,0,5,2014-06-08,review,0

We were a little confused as to how to get into the co-op, because didn't realize that it was on the opposite street all tucked away. After we figured that out by following another patron, we were really excited to walk through the doors. 

If you've never been into a co-op, you should know that they are typically smooshed together and have an interesting smell that emanates from the bulk-spices isle. I love this smell. It's really the best grocery store smell, EVER.

Proceeding through the store we noticed the colorful and abundant produce section. So many beautiful fruits, veggies and herbs. The prices varied, but they were probably on par with what you would pay for any other organic produce somewhere else. 

When we found the back area with hot foods, cold foods and the smoothies...I died of happiness. There were so many wonderful things back there. The food bar is $7.99 a pound, which is a lot cheaper than some places! The smoothies were all very tasty sounding, but I settled on a smoothie with soy ice cream, strawberries and papaya juice. Oh, my, god. It was so delicious! My boyfriend got the King smoothie, and he really enjoyed his too.

Right beside the smoothie bar there is a section for all kinds of books. My eye was caught by an organic and local homebrewing book. It is now on my list of must haves! 

The rest of the store was great. I especially love the cheese selection (we bought AMAZING and LOCAL tomato-basil havarti), the vegan meat products and the prices. 

I'll definitely be coming here a lot more. It's a great little co-op, and it is definitely the best I have been in!",1,-iVcmhjfq79QoTWzrb6pKg,1,5,2014-07-11,review,2

I was diagnosed with a soy allergy last year, so I was truly like a little kid in a candy store at East End Food Co-Op. There are so many options that not only accommodate my annoying food allergy but also support incredible local businesses.

For my first East End visit, I snagged several items, including incredible locally-made challah bread, three types of flavorful locally-harvested honey, cognac fig cheese, and my favorite amy's pizza in pesto, a flavor that I have never found elsewhere. Thankfully, I was shopping without a basket or cart, or I would have spent well over $100 on my first trip. Instead, I was trying to balance all my great finds in my arms, which limited my purchases.

My one warning about East End... don't expect Aldi or Trader Joe's prices here. Like Whole Foods, you'll be spending $50 or more on just a bad or two of groceries. Just remember that you're supporting multiple local businesses when shopping here, and you'll leave feeling fulfilled about your money spent!",2,-iVcmhjfq79QoTWzrb6pKg,0,5,2015-03-02,review,1
yid7st--ROgFLJaBg_Y0Iw,oVyeFQoP-c5InmKUKmindg,"The co-op is an invaluable resource for Pittsburgh. 

First of all, the selection is fantastic. No matter what kind of health-conscious diet you follow from vegan to paleo - they've got what you need. My favorite items here that you can't really find many other places are raw milk (legal in PA, woo!) and the local meats. The prices on the meat here are higher than most butchers in the area, but on par with the lesser quality meats at Whole Foods - choose your co-op!

I seldom find the produce prices to be ridiculously high. For example, I recently purchased mushrooms at $1.99 per lb. and strawberries for $2.50 per lb., which seem to be two of the more expensive items at any given store. Their sales are worth planning a shopping trip around.

When I followed a plant-based diet, the bulk section was my holy grail. For grains, flours, nuts, and seeds, they have a wide variety of unique products. I also love that you can fill a jar and buy it right at the store - most other bulk sections in the 'Burgh don't have this.

All in all, I like being able to go into a store and not have to sift through the produce to see if it's what I want (organic, local) because it all is! Naturally, they do sell tropical fruits and things that simply do not grow here, but everything is very clearly labeled in its origin and growing method.

The employees are always friendly and helpful as well. The only terrible thing about this place is the fact that there is almost NEVER parking - I've parked in the lot maybe  ten times out of the ~40 or so times that I've shopped here.

I can't tell you how long I have been looking for a place like this and even though it's slightly pricier than Trader Joe's/Whole Foods (or just about the same), I don't know about you, but I would rather pay for the quality of my food than for a name-brand jar of salsa.

One of the things that I liked most, is that they indicate on the glass of the hot food bar, which ingredients are organic- which I think is fabulous, because we have a right to know what we are eating! They sell Teatree oil, rosewater, and other bamboo cosmetic supplies. Almost all of their spices are organic, and they have a café where you can enjoy food that you might order fresh from the bar.

It's a great place to check out if you are remodeling your house or if you're interested in finding something funky you'd never be able to find anywhere else. 

The staff here is also super helpful and there will always be someone around to help you get your new purchase out to your car. 

CJ is also home to one of Pittsburgh's recycling drop off centers, so you can come here to sort out your commingled recyclables and then go shopping for a new mantle or some headless manequins. You really never know what you might find.",0,PavTvJ4JSe9rAwjlr-wrsg,0,5,2013-07-10,review,0

But I did not let that deter me from venturing out of my car and into the building.  Once you walk inside it is like walking into someone's garage that you just want to rummage through.  You know what I mean, you walk in and see all this dingy looking stuff that you see potential in.  You want to take it home with you.  sometimes you want to polish it up and make it look new, other times you want to let it be and let that distressed look shine through.

I easily spent a hour in here just browsing the shelves.  I saw potential in a lot of the items I saw lining their shelves.  And I took a few items home with me.  When I reached the register I was truly floored by the price.  When I say that, it's because it was so low.

Just drive a block off Penn Ave in Point Breeze, pull into a fenced-in parking lot, and head toward a little door attached to a deserted-looking warehouse. The little door opens into an old, dusty space filled with used home items. Don't forget to check out the crazy pieces of artwork suspended from the ceiling as you walk through! 

The warehouse has a range of items from treasures to no-one-would-ever-buy-this pieces. Today I saw:

-fabulous 1960s desks
-old scratched and/or locked filing cabinets
-retail display cases
-disassembled kitchen cabinets and countertops 
-ancient (and very intriguing) appliances 
-hundreds of toilets and bathroom sinks
-random bathroom and kitchen tiles
-carpet remnants
-lots and lots of random chairs
-light fixtures varying in quality from brilliant chandeliers to barely-operational

The list just goes on and on and on. Take the oddness of this list and multiply it by 3... then you're getting close to imagining what Construction Junction is like. 

Make sure to enter this store with zero expectations, no particular items to buy, and an empty home. Sadly, my home is filled (though I really wanted that 1960s desk...), and I had an item to buy (a filing cabinet). We left empty handed and drove straight to Office Depot, where I purchased a $90 (vs $25 here) filing cabinet that was not locked, had smooth-running drawers, and is not scratched up.

I first came to know these guys after encountering the office manager Linda at my place of work. After talking to her for a few minutes and finding out where she worked I started to tell her of my recent woes with ANOTHER dentist... a botched filling, an infection, a great deal of pain and the need for a root canal. Linda gave me the office's card and insisted that they would see me ASAP if I so desired. I did and it was a great decision, because relief soon followed.  

I have never had an appointment with these guys that I have not found to be an enjoyable experience. OK...I know that's saying a lot, due to the amount of poking and prodding and rather invasive metal hooks and drills that we all associate with a dentists office, but I'm serious. Everyone in this office from the front desk, the hygienists and the good Doctor himself, are all experts at what they do. The wait times are minimal. Usually, less than ten minutes. It's very rare that a doctor's office will respect the time of their patients in this fashion. There is always a courtesy call to remind you of your appointment a day or two in advance. The work is top notch + the location next to the Co-op is as geographically desirable and  as you can get.

I could go on and on, but instead I'm just going to close by saying, if you are looking for a dentist, you may have just stumbled upon the best one in the Burgh.

LmZ1Cwt5HMBiWv9nXjcHag,NeyqP6GHZ9sx7FwfOQegtw,"Very primitive bouldering area, but the routes were challenging, in part due to the lack of a smearable surface (plywood kinda painted to look like rocks),  mega shitty footholds (jibs worn down to shiny scummy nubs that sorely needed cleaning or replacing), and a distinct lack of fall-friendliness (one old mat to be shared among every 3 or 4 walls, and an unforgiving floor that thudded every time someone landed on it).  Not a bargain for a $12 day pass since the routes did not seem to have been changed very often and all climbs shared the same foot jibs which looked practically permanent. The changing room was literally a closet.

All that griping aside, there were some decent climbs. The V3's were fairly easy but the V3/V4's were exponentially harder.

- Tons of space and tons of gentle-ish climbs for the beginner/novice/padawan. Looots of V0, VB, V1, V2s... I think the hardest I saw was a V7. I don't boulder much more than a V2, and I found a lot of fun, challenging courses. It wore me out, but I felt like a superstar. (My local climbing gym is a lot harder.) That was great!
- They offer to play your music! I always appreciate that in a gym. It's cool to hear other people's tastes, it's cool to let my tastes get some air, and indeed one tires of the alt 90s Pandora station.
- That said, I did feel some Interpol-sounding pixie dust bewitch my ear drums. And I appreciate that. I always appreciate being able to rock out/feel cool while simultaneously lunging for the next hold.
- $16 for a day pass and shoes was not terrible. It wasn't great, either, but it wasn't terrible. (And what's in between a pro and a con?)
- Easy parking.


CONS
- A lot of the walls felt way too tall to be lacking a top rope. I'd guess some of the tallest walls were 10 ft. - and, dude, falling 10 feet on a (bouncy) floor is still super dangerous, especially if you fall in between a Tarzan lunge (and thus, awkwardly). They had a few mats which were ""strategically positioned"" and thus couldn't be moved, but even with those under me, I didn't feel so good. They felt little thicker than a down comforter. Dude, come on! I didn't break my neck, but my muscles were all a-trembly, my hands slick with sweat, and it was sheer terror that often kept me from lunging (Tarzan-style) to the next hold. I had to give up on a few climbs just because I didn't feel safe! And that is very lame. I would have felt a LOT safer if the 6+ ft. walls were just top rope-able, or if they bought some bigger, thicker mats and let people drag them around. A free helmet's not gonna help much if you land on your shoulder!
- I saw a kid wandering around who looked adorable, pubescent and a little intimidated. It seemed like his first time. It broke my heart, 'cuz he seemed to have gotten frustrated after trying a few of the climbs and not being able to get very far. I think he left after not very long. Does the gym offer kids classes? Or one-on-one instruction, especially if the person's totally new and under 15 or something? It just seemed like such a shame; I'd hate to have a kid get sour on climbing just because they had an awkward first time! People need to be taught this stuff! (To an extent.)
- $2 for the privilege of chalk. Seriously?

So, overall, I'm happy to have found a decent wall for my visit to da burgh, but I don't know if I would be happy living with it as my only go-to.",0,5V1K5DRpGrObijbtCuPbcg,0,3,2011-10-16,review,1

I've been climbing a bit longer than I had been when I first wrote this review, but I still give it 3 stars. If I could give it a 2.5 I might give it that.

The bourldering room is pretty big and there are lots of routes at a variety of levels, distributed more of less so that each wall has something for everyone. In the evenings it gets uncomfortably crowded, and has gotten worse in the past few years as the sport has seemed to get more and more popular. What gets me the most is that in the 2 years or so that I've been going here, very little has changed. Meanwhile, I've been exploring gyms all over the country that are expanding, have textured rather than plywood walls so you can actually smear, and have incorporated things like yoga and weight rooms into their memberships. Why can't Pittsburgh have that?

VOIibbDZ95seOQ3tiuQz5Q,WCkJKOkNn_BL4_aahiwH2w,"Pittsburgh doesn't really have its choice of indoor climbing walls, but I was pretty impressed by this location (though note, this review is just for bouldering). The bouldering area is huge, and on a Saturday afternoon surprisingly empty with no need to wait for any route. It's labeled from V0 upwards... although the floor is padded, the walls do go up pretty high (the 10ft estimate from before is accurate), so a fall would be pretty scary... they do give you an option to wear a helmet, but I saw nobody doing so.

The routes are all clearly marked, and difficulty seemed to correspond with rating - there are also a ton to choose from, so you won't get bored. One staff member in particular was amazing - Allen - who spent the time giving climbing tips and encouragement to whomever needed it. Costs are also reasonable ($12/day, + $3/shoes, $2/chalk), and it's located in a nice strip mall with the East End Co-Op nearby for food. Overall, not a bad place to spend an afternoon!",0,5V1K5DRpGrObijbtCuPbcg,0,4,2012-02-11,review,0
u2F_wCshIRLCKO0Un2R3ow,b2obCvbA0DijLc0ys0kAuw,"I'm giving this the ok rating, I am not an experienced climber but a beginner. The last climb I went out was a real one in Utah with my brother who got me all harnessed up only to instruct me to place my foot and hand level with my head and pull myself up . You can imagine how that went with my golden retriever feverish barking and running below instructing my brother to let me down lol.

So for a beginner I found the price to be ok I went with a group and paid 16$ for shoe rental and I guess climbing fee? We stayed for about two hours. We went on a Saturday it was very crowded probably 15-30 people in the place but there are so many choices you can still get a wall. There were several beginner climbs that are easy for anyone with a shred of upper body strength. Then some V2 and V3 and V4, the other beginner gals I was climbing with found there was a pretty big variation from the VB to V2 on some of the climbs. So sometimes it was better just not to follow the stickers completely if you're a beginner but still looking for variation while bouldering. 

I think safety-wise things are bit of a liability here, walls are high, mats are very old and very few. Also lots of people don't follow the basic rules including teenagers who are there alone. So be cautious of your space an d others space and consider fatigue when getting to the top of those walls with your hands all sweaty. 

I also expected it to be a little larger based on the website photos, but I understand that this is Pittsburgh not a city with room for a huge gym like out west. I also think if they were to build a bigger newer gym here with higher climbs, then you would be looking at paying $25 and up. 

My biggest complaint is that you can only do lessons at certain times with a harness, this makes it harder for beginners to get in and get a feel. I did complete one or two V7 or V8. Just to push myself but I would have had more fun if I had the support of a rope so the next time I go back I will consider classes. Which costs a little bit more but oh well. Class times are limited check the website.",2,5V1K5DRpGrObijbtCuPbcg,1,3,2012-02-25,review,4
ILE13Hj1w7YItpR7AEyLrw,4oRJ_d_dK_If0BlbJsX_hA,"Some helpful hints for the Climbing Wall:

-A one-day pass is $12.  College students/active military pay $10.  Wednesday is 1/2 price for ladies (but only after they pay full price on the first visit).  Wednesday is also 1/2 price for guys who wear a sports bra.  Yup, you heard me right.  Wednesdays are usually pretty crowded.

-They run a different membership special every month.  If you climb more than once a week, a membership can definitely be worth it.

-If it's your first time at the wall, I highly suggest just doing the ""bouldering certification"" instead of the ""safety and belay certification class.""  The bouldering certification takes about 5 minutes and then you can start climbing.  Decide if you like it, then do the belay certification.

-If you ""like"" them on facebook, you can get updates about when they change the routes, what membership specials they're running, if they're selling any old/used shoes for discounted prices, etc.  

The wall is in a great location, on several bus routes, and right next to the East End Food Co-op.  It can get crowded, but everyone takes turns so you have plenty of opportunities.",5,5V1K5DRpGrObijbtCuPbcg,1,5,2012-03-21,review,7

Bouldering routes are labeled from VB and V0 (easiest) all the way up to the insanely difficult V7 and V8, while the top roping routes are labeled from Easy to Hard.
 
Pricing is reasonable, especially on Wednesdays, which is ladies night--$6 to climb (after your first visit).  Other days the price is $12 or $10 for students/military plus the cost of equipment rentals.  If you plan on going at least once a week (or more often like me) buying a membership is the way to go, and there are different specials each month.

I'm sure a lot of people, including myself, wish this place was a little bigger, but for being in the city it's not a bad size. It's actually surprising how many routes they managed to plan out for the size of the place, there's more than enough to keep the walls feeling fresh even after many climbs. The diversity of the routes is really great too, there's plenty of routes for each skill level and climbing style.

That said, I've been climbing here at least twice a week for the last few months. It's not as large, and the walls aren't as high-tech as other places I've climbed, but the setters make good use of what's available.

Both the bouldering and top-roping routes seem to be re-set at just about the right rate -- there are always new-ish routes, but the turnover isn't so fast that one can't work on problems for a few successive visits.

I would love to see the walls refreshed in a cement faux-rock style, with more flowing curves and less strict geometry. (Also, plywood is slippery! Makes it hard to smear.)",0,5V1K5DRpGrObijbtCuPbcg,0,3,2013-02-26,review,1

Two entrances - one for top roping and the other for bouldering. I've only been bouldering and it's a good crowd.

Routes are VB (beginner) through around V6 with a lot of options at all ranges. A bunch are also unmarked so go with that if you're into a challenge. The other climbers are very friendly and will help you out.

Cubbies for your stuff, small room for you to change, bathrooms, water fountains. Ample parking if you aren't there at high time after work.

- At least there's a climbing gym in this area
- Walls get reset often

Cons:
- I've been coming here a couple times a week for the past few months now, and I have felt like some of the walls really need some padding besides the not-so-great spring board they have. The walls are pretty high and the height + lack of mats retract me from climbing certain routes, which is really disappointing because it ruins my climbing experience. 
- I brought up the aforementioned lack of mats to the woman who works here, and she snapped at me: ""Mats are only supposed to be under walls that are sloped."" I told her the wall I was talking about was sloped, and she replied curtly ""If you don't feel comfortable climbing those walls without a mat, then you shouldn't even be climbing them."" I was in shock. Is this a way you should be addressing your climbers' legitimate concerns? Even if it isn't possible to have mats, she could have at least told me in a nicer way instead of talking to me as if I knew nothing. 
- The gym closes at 11PM on Fridays. I usually go at night until they close, but the staff passive aggressively starts turning off the gym lights around 10:50PM. I get it, it's a Friday night and you want to get outta here. But the business hours are until 11PM, so let me enjoy my last ten minutes of climbing because I am paying for my climbing membership and I want to get as much climbing as I can get out of my sessions at the gym. 
- The holds are old and covered in rubber from the shoes. It would be nice if they could at least pressure wash them every once in a while.

Dreams crushed.  Only people that are belay certified can even be in the top rope room.  I would've had to pay $5 to test out of the certification and even if my friends wanted to take a quick lesson on how to belay, its only at very specific times and you need to give advanced notice.

So we bouldered.  The walls are old, made of smooth plywood and though the walls are a good variety, you eventually end up right on top of one another.  You can only top out on one tiny section, everything else backs right up to another wall or and abyss.  With someone who isn't super comfortable down climbing or jumping from the top, I wasn't always super excited to fall when there wasn't a nice big cushion.  Those were only on the overhanging walls.

The place was super busy on a Sunday afternoon and group after group rolled in.  I understood why there were so many VB and VB+ routes (easier than V0's).

Side note: cubbies are completely separate from the bouldering area and no food or drinks are allowed inside the bouldering area.  Therefore your water stays in your cubby, plan carefully.

5V8gktabBuWHoB83oFo_fw,VBTOldZkkfLuHw3z7Getqg,"There are some really good things to say about the climbing wall, but overall I was quite disappointed.  I wanted to like this place, so I'll start with the positive aspects.  

First of all, the gym in pretty cheap.  And the bouldering area is really quite good.  To be honest, this should only be a bouldering gym. There were a lot of different volumes, nice routes, some top outs, and a good cave area.  Even a small crack with a few problems set on it. 

It seems like whoever is in charge of setting the boulder problems really has some talent.  I might be back to bolder once in a blue moon.  The other climbers here were pretty cool, so the place might have a good vibe/community aspect. 


Now the downsides.  The staff wasn't very helpful.  The rules regarding the top rope area are nonsensical, and the only reasoning offered up was insurance. I wanted to belay for a friend, but he wasn't allowed in the top rope area unless belay tested. Belay testing also cost $5, and I hate when gyms charge for a test.  It's poor form. 

The ropes aren't doubled up, and with the short wall it gives way too much pull.  They require you to clip into daisy chains on the ground.  I wanted to lead climb, but there was no one at the gym that could give a lead test. The TR routes were really hit or miss, a lot of them just confusing and not fun. They aren't rated properly, just easy, medium, or hard. 

The walls are painted plywood, so smearing is basically impossible.  Further, I question if the holds have ever been cleaned.  Some of them are so polished to the point that it's dangerous.  

There's only once changing room, and overall the place isn't very clean.  I believe there is some potential here, but it seems to be mismanaged and on the whole, a missed opportunity.",0,5V1K5DRpGrObijbtCuPbcg,0,2,2014-12-15,review,2

Bouldering, though, is not my jam. I love climbing. The climbing space is much smaller than bouldering and, compared to the gyms in Colorado, much shorter routes (5-8 moves to the top, 15-30 ft).

FKxc9BUDj8pSohAkpttrxA,ROuHhbs6HF8wFs7YOkrXcA,"Really, really, really liked this place. Unfortunately only went bouldering so I can't rate the top roping.

I'll start with the reasons why I couldn't give it a full 5 stars: a lot of the holds are pretty greasy. Rather than using color coordinated holds, they're marked off by tape patterns - but a lot of the routes have been there for a while so the tape is peeling off for half of them and/or 5 different routes overlap every hold so it's pretty confusing often times. Lastly, the floor is fairly stiff, kinda like a gymnastics tumbling floor and there's not enough crash padding to cover the whole floor. Lastly, the walls themselves are wood, rather than traditional bouldering walls that you can smear on.

That seems like a lot to improve on...so why still such a high rating? Simply put, route creativity. All sorts of walls: straight, overhangs of all angles and curves, 360 degree traversing routes, cracks, one through a low tunnel, chimneys, etc. there are some REALLY clever routes that really make you think how to do them. I loved the routes here and wish I had more than a day in Pittsburgh to come back.

Price wise, a little cheaper than other bouldering gyms I've been to. $14 for a typical admission, with reduced rates on returns for some people (like students). They have a ""ladies night"" that men can also get in to if they were a sports bra as a top. Mildly sexist, but hey, it's all in good fun and the discount is extended to us so *shrug*

I eventually came here with my parents (who are not accustomed to non-Chinese establishments).  Arriving at 5:30 pm, we still were able to get a table without any prior reservation.  The host was the owner of the restaurant and gave a personal touch to the service.

The decor and environment gave Cafe Zinho a nice off-the-beaten path look.  Gypsy and bohemian.

Food was superb.  I had the quail, but wasn't given the appropriate utensils to eat it.  My mom loved the lamb.  And of course, the dessert was fabulous.  Since the kitchen is right now nearby, you can see the cooks making your meal or dessert.

This place only accepts cash although there's an atm nearby.  My mom had a fit because when they bill came they had rounded up with a difference of less than a dollar.  I would give this place 4.5 stars, but I rounded up.",0,l_Wey2YC6NvVUIH8vTygGg,1,5,2006-07-17,review,2

I'll never forget the stuffed zucchini blossoms: lovely! Monique is a gracious hostess. The restaurant used to be a garage -- check out the ceiling. Love it when they open the wall in the summer. Cash only. BYOB. Just off Ellsworth. Don't know if they treat everyone like family, but that's how they treat us. Highly recommended.

TckShYnQa0eD3WQxdoE3GQ,vjiztfu-QQDh0McQUbZ2Fg,"Very trendy cool out of the way place that I definitely suggest you check out.  This is a Tony Pais restaurant, he owns another more formal place downtown but I forget the name.  He used to own Baum Vivant on Baum Blvd.  This was a great place.  The last I was there was 7 or 8 years ago.  It was total formal fuu fuu fine dining, but what an experience.  Anyways, it's gone now and I haven't been to one of his places since until last night when a friend suggested we try this little oasis located on Spahr St.  This place is the opposite with respect to atmosphere than Baum Vivant.  It's in a converted garage with a few outdoor tables.  It's cash only and BYOB.  It's very informal and I got away with wearing tennis shoes and my ""Super Size My Foie Gras"" fruit of the loom t-shirt.  Don't need to get dressed up to enjoy amazing food.  The inside of the restaurant/garage has a high ceilings and an eclectic mix of non-matching tables that I imagine were collected from Thrift stores.  The service was awesome, spot on from start to finish.  The lovely european women who served and hosted had big smiles and a genuine appreciation when we said we liked the food.  The meal started with some warm rolls that they may cook on site.  It was served with ice cold butter.  That's fine, but let's get a little more creative people on the butter, dips with the bread.  The first course was this amazing artichoke soup.  This literally is the best soup I've tried since I can remember and I eat out all the time.  The flavor was layored with the cream, maybe nutmeg, maybe spinach, and also what tasted to me like a shellfish broth.  It was a very complex flavor.  Amazing!  Next was a goat cheese dish served inside of phyllo dough.  It was tasty, but a little too rich for my taste.  The inside of the dough had apricots mixed with the goat cheese and the sauce was some type of combination of walnuts and apples pureed'.  Interesting, but didn't add too much to the dish.  Also, we tried a smoked salmon appetizer served on croutons with capers.  It was perfect and I really like their portions here.  They don't try to kill you with the size of the dishes.  My friend ordered the crabcakes, which were two small mostly lump crabmeat portions.  They were delicious served with a mushroom cream sauce.  The rice that was served with the crabcakes were another story, totally tasteless and not seasoned well. The rice was also a liitle mushy.  I tried the Elysian Fields lamb burger.  I had never seen an Elysian Fields lamb burger, so I thought I'd give it a try.  It was a decent portion (4 oz. I'd guess) at a reasonable price $11.  I didnt' really get to tell the difference between regular lamb and Elysian because they overcooked the burger to well done and it lost much of the flavor.  Overall, I'll stick to Tessaro's for my burgers.  We finished with a chocolate mousse, which was okay but I thought too heavy for a mousse.  I got out of here with a $65 + tax bill for all this amazing food.  What's even better is that because it's byob I probably saved $30 for the bottle of wine as well.  I really like the fact I can have interesting food, relatively cheap in a casual atmosphere.  One last thing, they don't have AC so you may want to pick a cooler night if you plan on sitting indoors.  They also say they don't take reservations on the menu, but we were able to make a reservation on Sunday for Monday for two people.",0,l_Wey2YC6NvVUIH8vTygGg,0,4,2008-06-10,review,2

The menu is creative and dinner (soup, salad and salmon) were delicious, but there is nothing that Portugese about this place (except the decor and a very sweet older lady hostess who may in fact be Portugese).  In fact, I think it would be considered a national security threat in Portugal to have a place that serves dinner NOT serve wine.  The government of this state is partly to blame though.  Since when did PA become goddamn Utah?!  But Rendell's gotta get his cut I guess...

Anyway, the place is small and intimate, one server handles the floor.  Minus points for the lack of alcohol,and frozen butter with the bread, but this restaurant is a neighborhood gem.",0,l_Wey2YC6NvVUIH8vTygGg,0,4,2010-07-16,review,0

We tried the curry shrimp, which was extraordinary. I was not expecting it to be that delicious, and I would recommend it to anyone. The bread was fresh and very tasty. They had the white anchovy tower special appetizer with anchovies, tomato in olive oil. This was also excellent, and reasonably creative. The calamari appetizer had plenty of calamari and was very good.

The Zinho salad was just OK, which was our single disappointment. On the plus side, it had artichokes and hearts of palm. On the downside, we could have prepared it at home easily; the olives were from a can and tasted bland. 

All in all, great food minus the salad in a cozy place.

I'll say again that I'm not certain how the food is Portuguese.  That being said, it is mighty delicious.  I love the personal service.  I love the corn bread.

RsaEvod4EOBYIdbRBBv0sw,7akANQ5TN0Hb0UDRbEBV8Q,"This is the kind of restaurant that I deeply appreciate.  Family-owned.  Off the main roads.  Charming interior.  Unique staff.  WONDERFUL FOOD.  (We called this our ""less-expensive Casbah"" when we left).

Like everywhere we end up going, we go because a Yelp review we have read, that inspired us to give it a try.  We new it was BYOB, but we weren't in the mood for drinking, so we walked on over.  It was our own fault that we got there, at 5:00pm, on the dot - and they were not quite ready to be opened, as they were finishing setting up the tables.  My boyfriend and I took a quick walk around Ellsworth.  It's a family-owned business where they turned their front garage into the most charming, artsy-like, romantic restaurant.  We'll cut them some slack!

When we got back, they were ready for us; and we chose to snag a table outside (they thought we were nuts).  However, in one of the reviews, we read that they had no A/C, which was a big selling point for us (I absolutely loathe going into a freezing cold, A/C'd out restaurant, and being forced to bring a hoodie with me, when it's 90+ outside.  And we do kind of like hot, humid, and muggy); but, I guess they have upgraded because the A/C was BLASTING on the inside of the restaurant.

We started off with the Gazpacho.  This was a perfect summer starter because it was cool, extremely flavorful, and a natural air conditioner to the body.  It had lumps of shrimp and crab meat at the bottom, which made us feel like we were eating somewhere on Duval St. in Key West.  I normally don't like cilantro, but the cilantro was so subtle and completely rounded out the flavor.  When our waitress brought out the freshly baked loaf of corn bread, we sopped up the rest of it.  It is true, the wait staff genuinely appreciates your compliments and feels honored every time you say you enjoyed something.

I ordered the Wild Mushroom Ravioli and my boyfriend ordered the Lamb Burger.  When our dishes came out, they were the most beautiful dishes I had ever seen - full of color, wonderful portion sizing, and aromas just attacking the olfactory with sensational goodness.  My Ravs were topped with this grape tomato paquillo sauce, which tasted like it had hints of red pepper also.  It was FANTASTIC.  Plus, there were whole mushrooms, okra, carrots, and cauliflower on top of the dish as well.  I don't know what kind of separate seasonings were on the veggies, but they were to-die-for also.  I can't exactly remember how many Ravs were in my bowl, but every time I thought I was finished, there was another ravioli to be found, and then another.  For the price - I think there were a total of 10 fully-stuffed, hand-made mushroom ravs.  Incredible.

My boyfriend's Lamb Burger came with a cranberry and raisin jam (but ""jam"" seems to cliché of a word for this topping), and a salad that had slices of apples in it.  Now I'm usually not one to eat sweeter tasting foods; however, the complementing of sweet and savory in this dish blew my mind.  I'm also not a big fruit eater (unless it's blended in a smoothie), but I totally got past all that because the flavors and the textures all are playing nicely with one another.

We opted out of dessert because we were so stuffed.  But our bill for an appetizer and two filling, insanely delicious entrees came to $40.  DING DING DING DING DING!  WE HAVE FOUND A WINNER!  

After dinner the owner came over to our table and we were introduced.  What a wonderful, sweet, and genuine older guy.  We will definitely be back before the menu changes again; and next time, we're going for entrees and dessert!!

After passing by Cafe Zinho for years and years I finally hopped into a hidden Portuguese oasis. Who knew the little hole in the wall near my old hair salon had such good food?! My friends and I had known long about it, but last night we were in need of a BYOB ($5 corkage) and found much more than that. 

We started with two appetizers. (A very good tip from a fellow yelper!) One friend is majorly allergic to gluten and our fabulous waiter MORE than accommodated her questions and requests with patience. We all shared some kind of rice stuffed pepper that was moist and exploding with flavor, I forget the name...but definitely a must-have. We also were excited to try the pan-sauteed (not fried) calamari. I'm not a huge fried calamari fan, but this was swimming in olive oil and fresh herbs...it was a lovely delight away from a typically americanized version. 

We also ordered the tomato bisque and the soup of the day. These were insane! The best soups I've ever had out. The soup of the day was a roasted creamy mushroom soup and I almost licked my bowl clean. The flavors were outstanding and we all couldn't decide which soup was better. Make sure to definitely soak everything up with their delicious table bread that seemed to have just come out of the oven every time they replenished our basket! 

Something worth passing is yes, the salads...they're just okay. But my friends raved about their pork and I will not forget the visual of my friend picking up the bone to lick it clean while our waiter just laughed at us! :) 

Best part of the story? Well, the food takes a lonnggg time to come out, (warning, but probably because it is so fresh!) after finishing our bottle, our neighboring diners also took advantage of the BYOB but seemed to have left half of theirs when they were done! So after a silly little dare, we became the table of three that snuck 3 large pours of wine and placed it back on their table! Hey! Who was going to drink it anyways?! The little portuguese owner came over and was sincerely shocked at how the wine bottle was empty...she asked, ""Did you three drink this?"" We giggled and my friend's boyfriend said, ""YES."" She smiled, and let us have our moment.

The food was good. We ordered the tomato garlic bisque, which was delicious. The stuffed peppers with crab and goat cheese were tasty, but the plate was super hot and the peppers were cold, so that was a bit off. For main courses we ordered the salmon and the lobster ravioli. The salmon was great. It w cooked well and had a dill cream sauce on it. It was supposed to be served with risotto, but instead came with a dried cake of old creamy looking rice. I ignored that and ate the steamed and grilled veggies they used to garnish the plate. The lobster ravioli was amazing, but instead of coming in it's own sauce, they simply poured on the tomato garlic bisque that we had already ordered as a first course.

My two friends were already there and then... there was just me in the restaurant, which scared me a little bit but I have to have faith in my fellow Yelpers. 

The waitress was an adorable woman who was so friendly, helpful and enthusiastic about the dishes in a quiet manner. You just wanted to pinch her cheeks or something. Anyway she gave us some bread which was sweet, unlike many of the other restaurants breads that I have had, which I enjoyed. We ordered the goat cheese for an appetizer which was just so ooey and gooey deliciousness and then for the piece de resistance ordered the sea bass special that night which had capers, a potato, rice and some roasted vegetables. Great light combination and not too heavy. The size of the sea bass was like of the entire whole fish.

I have driven by it many times without even realizing it was a restaurant. 

Thankfully, my more knowledgeable girlfriend recommended checking it out, as she had to buy me dinner. Cruel world, I know.

We were able to get an early reservation on a Saturday, pick up a bottle of wine ( a must!) and make it relatively on time. Intimate is precisely the word I would use to describe this living room dining experience. The waitresses are what you would want your host mom to be like from a foreign country, and splendidly cheery.

We ordered two apps, both delicious. They also served some impeccable cornbread as well. The first app was a pastry sort of thing covered in goat cheese, that was worthy of plate licking, had it been socially acceptable. The second was a batch of clams in a fragrant tomato sauce (the sauce also went well on the goat cheese pastry). Most of the time when I order clams, they are far too fishy, but these were perfect.

The lady friend ordered the special, a quail dish, while I ordered lamb osobuco. The portions were very generous, and you could easily see the care and prep that went into each individual dish. I must say, the quail was divine. I ended up super jealous and contemplated tricking the gf to turn around so I could switch plates while she was distracted. It was a mixture of sweet and layered with spices, the meat juicy and rich. 

The lamb was textured and cooked very well, however it seemed to lack a distinctive flavor to bring out the qualities of the meat itself. Perhaps more garlic or such.

I called and they said they were quite busy but if I could get there quickly, they had an open table for us.  Before hanging up they reminded me to bring a bottle of wine if I wanted one.  We made a quick stop at the nearby wine and spirits shoppe, bought a Spanish red, and showed up at Cafe Zinho.  They offered us the choice of two tables and immediately opened our wine, and brought over two nice stems.  The waiter gave us menus, described the daily specials and gave us time to mull it over.  We both ordered the soup of the day, a pumpkin bisque, my wife just ordered their Zhino side salad as her entree, and I chose a lamb burger (not Elysian Fields lamb, I asked).  Our waiter brought us a basket of what I suspect to be Portuguese bread.  It had a delicious sweetness. Our soups came out fairly quickly.  The bowls held a hearty serving of the delicious (and filling) cream soup.  After clearing our empty bowls our waiter bought out our entrees.  My wife's side salad was large, as side salads go.  She was quite pleased with it.  It had baby greens, tomato, olives, hearts & reduced red wine vinaigrette.  I had a taste and agreed with her assessment.  My lamb burger was huge!  It was at least an inch thick and was topped with feta and fruit chutney.  It came with a salad that filled any remaining space on the plate not taken up by the burger.  Note to self- do not order a salad if you're going to order the lamb burger!  I ordered the burger cooked medium-well, even though the waiter sort of tried to talk me into medium.  It came out just the way I wanted it, with just a hint of pink in the middle, and full of delicious juices.  My wife agreed that it was extremely yummy!  I cut the burger in half and managed to eat one of the halves along with about half the salad before I ran out of room.  My wife made it about halfway thru her salad by then, and she too gave up.  We asked for doggie bags and our waiter packed our meals up in containers and put them in a plastic bag for us.  It was a very nice meal and dining experience.

Pros: BYOB, tasty food, reasonable noise level, outdoor sidewalk dining is available seasonally, friendly and attentive service (if a bit unpolished).
Cons:  Ambience (it originally was a gas station) and there is nothing fancy about the funky decor, tables are packed every which way into the available interior space.",0,l_Wey2YC6NvVUIH8vTygGg,0,4,2012-10-06,review,0

Menu was somewhat limited, although we didn't try any starters which many of the other reviews state are the best offerings on the menu. I ordered the seafood stew and my husband had the chicken dish. The stew had seafood: clams, mussels, shrimp, scallops, and some type of summer sausage, but not much else. The broth was oily. My husband's chicken was prepared adequately; however the rice it was paired with was extremely underdone while the veggies were over-cooked and mushy. 

I might go back once more with a bottle of wine for appetizers only but for the price I will dine on entrees elsewhere.",0,l_Wey2YC6NvVUIH8vTygGg,0,2,2012-10-12,review,1

-la6YVHqiwf2fR8o617mBQ,8uldBwBGkCZfmGZZpkEHEw,"Most of the reviews we read called this place ""comfy"" or ""quaint,"" which translates into ""a very small restaurant."" It seems that the small size of the place ensures that every meal is attentively prepared because our food came out perfectly executed.

My husband had a crab and salmon tartar appetizer, while, simply from reading reviews, I walked in knowing what I wanted: goat cheese in puff pastry swimming in a shallow dish of creamy asian pear sauce. I literally wiped every bit of sauce off my plate with their bread.

Which, speaking of bread, the Portuguese cornbread is to die for. I highly recommend buying a $2 loaf to take home and (as recommended by one of the waitresses), make yourself a few thick slices of french toast.

For dinner, my husband had duck with a Grand Marnier sauce and I had Cornish game hen in a butter wine tarragon sauce. Both were served with simply dressed cauliflower, broccoli, peppers, and red potatoes. Again, we ate every bit of food off our plates and sopped up the extra sauce with our bread.

We did happen to order the two most expensive entrees on the menu, and both had appetizers, but I think $85 is absolutely reasonable for the high caliber food we received.

1zJL9PogiFyd_NhGcbgs7Q,fHK4RZvuTuOvFc1gkwcxcg,"This was the first time for me and my wife at the celebrated Cafe Zinho. Parking in the residential area in which the restaurant is located is next to impossible on a busy Saturday night; the diner should be prepared to walk a distance to get to the restaurant from where he or she is ultimately able to park.  The greatest drawback is that the restaurant is tiny and the seating so tight that at our table, it was necessary to sit uncomfortably in order to avoid being bumped by anyone that walked by, which happened repeatedly as we were in a busy thoroughfare of food delivery.  No other table offered a much better situation and all others were occupied at the busy time we arrived, 6:45 p. m. The online menu boasts of a daily vegetarian and vegan special entree, but there was no such entree on this night.  There was only one non-meat item on the small menu, ravioli.  Our gracious server, Ramon, said that the kitchen could prepare a couscous and vegetable dish if the vegetarian in our party wanted it, and that was what we did.  The restaurant permits customers to bring their own alcoholic beverages, a nice convenience and savings for the diner.  A small portion of bread was served with a tiny amount of rock-hard butter.  My mushroom and cheese soup was a large portion, served piping hot, which was great, but it was a puree with no distinct mushroom pieces.  I would not have been able to distinguish it as mushroom soup.  All of our entrees were attractively presented and were tasty, average size portions.  All were served with a small amount of good, fresh vegetables. It would be helpful if the menu offered some description of the following entree so that the diner with an interest in a chicken dish would not have to inquire about it of the server:  ""chicken maputo
Roasted w/ piri piri & chocolate scented sauce"".  Does the average diner know what ""maputo"" and ""piri piri"" are? The lemon tart dessert was a small piece not suitable for sharing, served with two minute pieces of strawberries and a small dollop of whipped cream.  It was not flavorful or moist nor worth the calories.  The gracious owner, Tony Pais, stopped at our table for a moment to greet us, a nice touch, and there were quality checks by a manager and Ramon.  I noticed a number of prominent people from the community dining here, individuals whom I was surprised were willing to spend a good deal of money to be packed into a sardine can of a restaurant.  Apparently they consider this to be the only restaurant in town.  The rest rooms are small, one-person facilities, naturally. An unfortunate surprise occurred when the individual that was picking up the check for my party presented his credit card only to be told that the restaurant accepts only cash and checks, this for a tariff of $148 plus gratuity.  It is supposed to be of some consolation that there is an Automatic Teller Machine on site.  I imagine less than 1% of expensive restaurants today are cash only.  Cafe Zinho is a highly flawed restaurant, demonstrating that there is more to a fine dining experience than simply offering fine cuisine.  If one is able to get beyond the feeling one has when visiting the rest room on a commercial airliner, the diner might enjoy it: not us.

I posted comments about the restaurant at its Facebook page, in which I noted my displeasure with being cramped and uncomfortable, and about the restaurant being unique in its unwillingness to accept credit cards for a $148 check.  An individual identifying himself as the manager, who apparently had never received constructive criticism from anyone, initially demonstrated rage, posting a message that I can go to the Oiive Garden the next time I dine out.  He later added with similar condescension that I can use a coupon and a credit card at The Olive Garden.  Later, he thought better of his outburst and removed the comments...along with mine.  He ultimately offered me and my wife the opportunity to return to the restaurant at his expense.  I thanked him for the offer, but told him that one experience at Cafe Zinho was enough.  I had no intention of returning even if he had responded to my comments like a gentleman.",0,l_Wey2YC6NvVUIH8vTygGg,1,1,2013-04-28,review,1

The Portuguese bread served before our meal was crusty, warm, and special -- a cross between a French loaf and cornbread. Unfortunately, things went down hill from here. The highly recommended goat cheese and phyllo dough tart was too rich and too mild, The pears didn't give enough sweetness and there wasn't any salt. So, it was just creamy. Plain and creamy.  

Between us we had three entrees. The salmon was my favorite of the three. It was an interesting preparation and well done. But, nothing special. The monk fish special was too sweet for my taste and a bit tough. (I don't want to have to use a knife to cut my fish.) I appreciated the homemade pasta and delicate flavors of the ravioli, but it was just too bland. A bit of salt or spicy or something would have been nice.

043GttuQ7d_kDvQemhLjxQ,VYEd_Z7Z8YBE1eb4au09KQ,"I had a wonderful meal and terrific evening at Cafe Zinho. Before I talk about the food, however, I want to explain why I'm giving Zinho only 4 stars. There are two major factors that negatively affected my overall experience. First, for a restaurant as expensive as Zinho (somewhere between $80-100 for two people), I think it's absurd that they don't accept credit cards. They are CASH or PERSONAL CHECK ONLY. For a place like this - with prices like these - it just comes off as cheap. Secondly, when I called to make a reservation, they encouraged me to bring a bottle of wine (it's BYOB), but did not mention the corkage fees, which will vary depending on the number of people and the number of bottles. It just seemed strange to not mention that additional charge when I called to make the reservation. True 5-star restaurants might work transaction and corkage fees into their menu prices, but I think the quality restaurant culture is beginning to move away from charging separate fees.

Those minor complaints aside, our meal at Cafe Zinho was phenomenal. I wanted something upscale and out-of-the-ordinary for our one night in Pittsburgh. We drove 10 miles from downtown - through sudden blizzard conditions - specifically for this place. Though neither of us are huge seafood aficionados, their menu is very accessible to both adventurous and more reticent eaters. 

For an appetizer, we ordered the puff pastry-encased goat cheese, laid in a sweet pumpkinseed sauce. The entrees really stole the night, however. I ordered the mussels in a vodka tomato sauce laid overtop pappardelle pasta. The sauce included chopped onions and other spices worked right into it, making its consistency chunky rather than ""creamy"" - the word used by the menu description. My fiancé ordered the crab cakes with the lemon-vanilla glaze. Both of us were blown away by these entrees, not to mention obsessed with their Portuguese cornbread that they bring to the table (out of this world). For dessert, the options change - but it appears they usually have a cheesecake and mousse option.  

The staff was helpful, kind, and very invested in their food. The ambiance is very intimate: a small place with a seating capacity of no more than 35, original art lining the walls, and a small bar at the entrance (it's more of a server area because they don't serve alcohol on the premises). Overall, a really memorable evening, only slightly marred by those strange fees, which could be easily avoided. Just remember your checkbook and be prepared for corkage fees - if you go prepared, the only surprises will be the delicious kind offered by Cafe Zinho.",0,l_Wey2YC6NvVUIH8vTygGg,0,4,2014-01-23,review,1

59A-ZxUMOgIl2MAnySh-Aw,acnW3ikJVnn-elyCPGG87Q,"Based on the menu, I would classify Cafe Zinho as more of a general fine dining restaurant rather than a Portuguese specialty restaurant. There are some Portuguese items, but I feel the emphasis is on providing high quality dishes non-specific to any particular cuisine.

For starters, we were brought corn bread which was great. It had a great textural contrast with the flakiness of corn bread along with the fluffiness of loafs.

Next, we had frog legs in a lemon and white wine sauce. The sauce was very pleasant as it highlighted a contrast among bittery, buttery, and sweetness. We dipped many pieces of corn bread in the sauce. Most of the flavor of the frog legs came from the sauce. The frog legs themselves were very chewy. I suspect that they were prepared in an oven; I think quickly grilling or quickly deep frying the frog legs might yield a more pleasant texture.

The main entree was great! I had the filet of trout which comes with grilled vegetables. The grilled veggies were simple yet well executed. The trout was nicely seasoned and cooked. I was able to appreciate the taste of the fish as well as the light seasoning. I wish the trout's skin was a bit crispier; however, I want to emphasis the the fish was cooked very much to my liking.

All in all, the food was very good. The main entrees were quite pricey. You're likely to be spending at least $30 per person.",0,l_Wey2YC6NvVUIH8vTygGg,0,4,2014-04-18,review,0
AMuyuG7KFWJ7RcbT-eLWrQ,tbCbFawg0dhEsvaOtOd79w,"This is a cozy little place. I made last minute reservations for a Saturday evening because the restaurant we were supposed to go to  closed due to an emergency. Major bummer for us, but life goes on and luckily we were able to get a table at this place. At first we were seated by the register area and that was a little awkward because it felt like the hostess and waitresses were right at the table with us. I wasn't in the mood for a large group dinner so we asked to be moved, a request they graciously accomodated. Unfortunately, we were then seated pretty close to the door and it was a cold February evening so that was a little rough. Fortunately, we had a whole bottle of wine to warm us up.

OK, so now let's talk about the wine thing: 
this is the first BYOB place I've ever eaten at and I loved it! It's pretty great to share a bottle of wine that you can pick out yourself, rather than spend a fortune on some ordinary bottle offered by the restaurant. I didn't know if we had to open the bottle ourselves and brought a cork screw just in case, but turns out they open it for you; I can't remember if there was a corkage fee, but it they do it's a small fee.

Now, for the food: we shared a sardine appetizer and it was quite good. The bread was also really delicious, very fresh and soft. For my entree I ordered the lobster tail and that was very tasty! The veggies served alongside were cooked perfectly and the sauce was light and flavorful. We ended the meal with a chocolate mousse, which my partner didn't love, but I thought it was pretty good, definitely not the best I've had, but good!

The proprietor of Zinho is one of the nicest gents in the business as far as I'm concerned.  I know this because I had occasion to collaborate with him on a few events 10 years ago.  So while I may be a bit biased, 10 years in between interactions sort of negates that in my opinion.  My point is, if you're one of those people that enjoys patronizing establishments run by nice people, Zinho fits the bill.  

We arrived last night for my birthday dinner at 7:30 and I immediately fell in love with the place. Nestled along the ""homey"" part of Ellsworth Avenue, Zinho exudes a relaxed luxury that might cater to customers of all types.  Our server Ramon was wonderful, and made thoughtful recommendations for each course.  I selected a roasted beet and goat cheese salad as a starter and crab cakes for my entrée.  Neither disappointed. The salad was a tower of carefully combined goodness and the crab cakes were stuffed, not with filler, but succulent crab.  While I'd get the crab cakes again, next time I'm in for the lamb, since one bite of Jonathan D's dish had me hooked so hard I practically baaa'ed (poor lamb).  At $180 for four people it isn't the cheapest option in the 'Burgh, but by no means is it the most expensive.

For appetizers, we got chicken livers and portuguese bread pudding with mushroom cream sauce. The chicken livers lacked flavor, which is unfortunate because chicken livers on their own are not very tasty. The bread pudding was pretty good though.

Entrees were, on the whole, not impressive. The lamb chops were obviously over cooked (we ordered medium rare, and the insides were almost fully cooked). The duck breast which people raved about online were tough and the sauce was too sweet. The seafood stew lacked flavor.

We splurged with three starters:  grilled sardines, octopus, and pheasant terrine.  Each was lovelier than the next.  The terrine was particularly delicious, served with some sort of artisanal mustard and pickled onions on the side, and some nicely grilled bread.  The octopus was perfectly cooked, not rubbery at all, but buttery, nicely seasoned and presented.  The sardines were grill-hot with an ever so slightly charred and crispy skin, and the accompanying vegetables were barely warm, which actually made for a nice contrast.

Main courses:  I had the shellfish stew from the menu.  All of the various seafood was perfectly cooked.  The broth could have had a bit more heat for my taste, but still: lovely.  The husband had one of the specials: cassoulet with venison osso buco. Heavenly, especially on a winter evening.  Gorgeous venison shanks and dome nicely roasted vegetables.

Another splurge: dessert.  We had the chocolate terrine and the key lime creme brûlée, both of which were understated and luxurious.  Not fans of big, vulgar desserts, so these were right up our alley--rich, flavorful, just a nice sweet little end to a perfect meal.

I had high hopes, especially with how much I loved the ambiance. I love tomato bisque, so I was excited to dive into that for a first course, but it was very strangely thin. When you imagine bisque, you imagine heavy cream used, but I believe it was broth based. I just wasn't digging it. 

But then our starter came out, a goat cheese-stuffed puff pastry, and it was divine! Things were looking up! It was a delicious mix of cheese, plus light and airy puff pastry that we gobbled up. 

Me and a friend split two main courses; the Butternut Squash Ravioli with Pumpkin Coulis and the lamb burger with fontina and caramelized onions. I love lamb and I love squash, so this was the perfect splitting combo. I was pretty bummed when the lamb burger, while good lamb, didn't give off a lot of flavor. Which was surprising considering it also had caramelized onions, which usually pack a flavorful punch. The butternut squash ravioli also didn't offer the flavors imagines. Mostly it was the sauce that seemed to fall flat with this dish. 

There was a sweet ending my friends, this cute little mason jar filled with layers of fresh raspberries, cream and Portuguese cookies was an amazing finish. I only wish everything had been equally as amazing.

I still feel like I'm not done with Cafe Zinho, so hopefully the next visit will be all wines, er wins!",5,l_Wey2YC6NvVUIH8vTygGg,2,3,2015-01-30,review,6

To be fair, what they put in your food is quality stuff: the lamb and duck we had are nice pieces of meat, but they are not made into the type of dishes you'd expect for something worth ~$25 a piece.

RWSBzkqH2-lsQDH8gVBuEw,1oKTfc0ZRModlq-dvY7N6A,"3.5 really.  There is a lot to like about Café Zinho and I'd definitely go back, but there are a couple of things that have to pull the star rating down a bit...

The good...
- The place itself is really cute.  It's a converted garage covered with an eclectic mix of décor that gives it a nice homey feel.  Lots of really nice details - old doors make up the ceiling, bright paints, mismatched but somehow coordinated chairs and tables, etc. 
- The server was very friendly.  She was attentive and helpful, and she recommended an excellent dessert (some sort of cookies, cream, and berries concoction that was just the right amount of sweet to end the meal)
- The food (with the exception of the goat cheese and beet stack) was delicious and a nice break from the standard Pittsburgh fare.  We started with the goat cheese puff pastry and tomato bisque.  Both were delicious.  The soup was thinner than I would have expected for a bisque, but I actually preferred it that way.  The lamb burger was so simple (lamb patty, cheese, and dijonaisse); but it was so good.  I'd go back for that.  The goat cheese and beet had potential, but it was semi-frozen and had a weird texture because of that.  

The bad...
-  I thought most of the menu was a bit over-priced.  Not grossly over-priced, but definitely on the higher end and the miscellaneous charges add up.  There is also a $4 split plate charge, which got us a little extra of the side dish with the burger we split.  And there is a $5 corkage fee for the BYOB.  
- Their policies toward groups stink.  No separate checks for parties over 4?  Grrr...  My party of exactly 4 was also presented a single check (we split some stuff, so I get it), but it would have been nice to have the option.  I see why because they write and figure the tickets by hand, but WHY in this day and age are we doing that by hand?   
- Cash only.  I don't carry that kind of cash around regularly and it's annoying to have to make a special trip to the ATM before dinner.",1,l_Wey2YC6NvVUIH8vTygGg,0,4,2016-04-06,review,0

kWkgwRxqWD-h260dMTkHUA,olYk97364VIPiY7IwBNV0A,"I stopped by here this past Tuesday evening with my parents and wife for my actual birthday dinner.  Cafe Zinho has been on my list of bookmarks for years and for some reason I had never made it there.  Perhaps it's the lack of a website or the fact that they aren't open on Sunday's or Mondays.  In any case I called at about 2 PM on Tuesday asking if I could make a reservation for 7 PM that night for a party of 4.  I was told that we could and to not forget that it was BYOB.  Our party arrived shortly after 7 PM to find a completely empty restaurant.  So we were given our choice of tables and I ended up choosing us a table right near the open doors.  The inside of cafe zinho is what I would call eclectic although still tastefully decorated.  There also didn't seem to be any air conditioning which was ok since the evening wasn't too hot and we were right near the open door.

For dinner, I decided to start off by having the calamari.  It came in a soup like pot with cous cous and a curry base.  The calamari in it was quite tender and it may well have been the best cooked calamari that I have ever had.  Meanwhile the curry had a good but subtle flavor while the cous cous provided something of substance.  It was the best appetizer that I have eaten in awhile.  Then for my entree I decided to go with the Grand Marnier Duck.  The duck was cooked nicely and had a good crispy exterior.  Meanwhile the sauce had a nice orange flavor and I thought that it was tasty.  Then the accompaniments were a couple of fingerling potatoes and a few other sparse vegetables that seemed to be copied on other entrees as well.  It was here that I would have liked to see the entree improved upon.  While the duck wasn't as good as the calamari had been it still ended up being a good entree.

The bottom line for me is that I would head back to Cafe Zinho again in the future.  I absolutely loved my appetizer and the fact that it was BYOB and thought that my entree was pretty good as well.",0,l_Wey2YC6NvVUIH8vTygGg,0,4,2016-07-04,review,1

iTmWHtltCtk0Gm55AOxrUA,JtsZ_2VXCv0a3mgda93oeA,"Despite the bloody labor battles that were fought at the old Homestead Steel Mills, the Frick Art and Historical Center is a very beautiful and quiet place to spend the day.  It is complex of museums and  buildings set in several acres of lawns and gardens in Pittsburgh's East End.  It is a wonderful place to bring your out of town guests or just spend by yourself.

You begin your tour with the Helen Frick Art Museum, located on Reynolds Street.  It features  porcelains, bronzes, and rare examples of 17th and 18th-century furniture.  Current exhibits include Steel: Pittsburgh Drawings by Craig McPherson and A Panorama of Pittsburgh: Nineteenth-Century Printed Views. They will  remain on view through June 8, as part of Pittsburgh's 250th anniversary.

Next we have the Car and Carriage Museum.  Henry Clay Frick was apparently quite an auto enthusiast.  His 1914 Rolls Royce Silver Ghost touring car is here as is the first car reportedly registered in Pittsburgh.  My husband Rick likes the 1931 Lincoln.

Then we move on to my favorite, the Greenhouse, the Gardens, and the Lawns.  I believe that admission is free if you just want to stroll around the lawns, which I like to do on a Sunday in May.  In the late 19th Century, greenhouses were very popular with wealthy families.

Finally we come to the house itself, Clayton.  It was purchased for the then princely sum of $22,000 by the Frick's in 1882.  It is done in the Italianate style.  Over 93% of the furnishings in the house are original, and that's what makes it so wonderful.  You get a fair sense of how the Fricks lived--quite a contrast to the steelworkers!  

No stop to the Frick is complete without visiting the cafe.  They believe that good food is an art too and the service here is wonderful.  I took a friend out for her birthday recently.  We had lunch at the cafe, the menu rotates seasonally.  I tried the Shrimp Tostones, which was sauted white shrimp, autumn sprouts, toasted almonds, guava cream, and annatto oil.  In the mood for more ""traditional"" museum fare like hot dogs?  Then try the ""Ultimate Chili Dog"".  Per the website, it is Grilled chicken apple sausage, wild boar chili, grated Gruyere cheese, caramelized onions, and mustard piccalilli on a sourdough roll!

Don't forget to have tea here too.  It is wonderful and the service is impeccable!  You and your guests can easily spend a whole afternoon here!",2,XWLtYPhCpHht5Zn52zp3-Q,1,5,2008-04-03,review,4

The Frick Art Museum is not really that interesting or great. There is hardly anything of note. As far as I can see, Helen Frick had way more money than taste and money can't buy you taste. When J.P. Morgan died, he donated his entire art collection to the Met in New York. However the Met did not want everything. Helen Frick bought many pieces that the Met had already passed on, with good reason. Of course not all of the Frick Art collection consists of the Met's castoffs. There many portraits of insignificant nobility done by French court painters who had little talent. Just bec. art is old or expensive, doesn't mean it's really any good. It's a good thing this museum is free.",1,XWLtYPhCpHht5Zn52zp3-Q,0,3,2008-05-17,review,4

The Frick Art & Historical Center has all the bases covered when it comes to museums: historical site, visual art, beautiful grounds, classic cars and buggies, restaurant, greenhouse.  Not to mention that everything -- with the exception of the house tour -- is free.  No one could possibly say there's *nothing* that here interests him here.  Husband certainly couldn't convince me.

I kid.  He's a trooper.

We arrived at the Frick on a gorgeous blue morning and started out with an excellent tour of the Frick family abode.  When the family moved to New York City after Henry Clay struck it rich in the steel business, they kept their house in Pittsburgh for return visits to the city; 93% of what's in the house is original to the Frick family, which always makes a house tour more interesting to me.  They lived lavishly, and Frick was an avid art collector.  His personal collection -- displayed both in the home and museum -- is impressive.

After our tour we visited the Car and Carriage Museum, which had husband transfixed with its Model T Touring Car, Rolls Royce Silver Ghost, American Bantam Convertible Coupe, Panhard et Levassor Tonneau and Lincoln Model K Sport Phaeton among others.  Finally, we finished up with a spin around the Art Museum itself.  It's a beautiful building with a very manageable size.  I was thrilled to find a current exhibition of Medieval Persian pottery -- found along the ancient Silk Road route -- currently running as well.

The gift shop building was once a playhouse for the children and you can still see where gutters for the bowling alley run through the middle of the floor.  It was a great place to start the tour and begin learning about the family and their connection to the area and American industry.  I am not a Pittsburgh native, so I knew very little about them.  It is important to note that you can't bring large bags with you on the tour, but they do provide free lockers to store them while you are in the house.

The tour continued by entering the house.  The enclosed porch provides a coat rack so you don't have to lug it around with you.  The house is detailed as if the Frick family was still living there.  We learned from our docent that they were fortunate that one of the family members lived there through the 1980s, so the house was well maintained and preserved.  Each room has exquisite detail and decor.  Our guide spent a great deal of time explaining and showcasing the art work.  Many local Pittsburgh artists were featured along with well known artists such as Monet.  Every aspect of the rooms were detailed including showcasing the new development at the time, aluminum.  The rooms upstairs featured less detail but were still interesting.  

After our visit to the house, we stopped in the green house.  I'm not that in to plants, but it was interesting to learn that the plants grown there are used in the cafe.

Speaking of the cafe, we stopped in just to check it out.  They were fully booked that day (which is fine since we weren't planning on eating anyway) but we were so enticed by the dessert selections that we got two desserts to go.  A nutella cheese cake and a baked apple.  We enjoyed those later that evening after dinner.

I am not that in to cars, but the car and carriage museum was very interesting.  The first section is carriages that the Frick family used.  My favorite was their ""special occasion"" carriage that even had  foot warmer!  The car area featured various automobiles that had a connection to Pittsburgh.  There is also the option of watching three short videos about automobiles in Pittsburgh.

The art museum alone is worth a visit.  They were preparing for an exhibit when we were there so only the Italian and French sections were open, but they were fantastic.  A great collection with amazing detail and descriptions of each of the paintings.  The interior of the building is an attraction itself.  It does not look like it was built in the 1960s with the fantastic marble and woodwork.

Overall, a very enjoyable place to visit that I highly recommend to anyone because there really is something for everyone at Frick.",4,XWLtYPhCpHht5Zn52zp3-Q,1,5,2014-02-25,review,5

The Frick is essentially 5 small sights in one. 

The grounds.  Nice 5 acre area that is well maintained giving a park like atmosphere.

The greenhouse. Lovely little greenhouse you can walk through.

The car museum is neat but currently closed for 18 months.  An early electric and steam car are the highlights.  Lots of olds rolls royces.

The cafe. Food.

The Clayton house.  12 dollar tour worth every penny.  The house tour takes about one hour and really is fascinating.  Not a huge mansion.


All in all just a nice place.",0,XWLtYPhCpHht5Zn52zp3-Q,0,5,2014-06-03,review,1

However, this review is for First Fridays @ the Frick, which takes over the grounds of 7227 Reynolds Street for just a couple Friday nights each summer. These couple Fridays nights have become one of my favorite Pittsburgh traditions. 

For summer 2014, there are three concerts happening at the Frick...

MEETING OF IMPORTANT PEOPLE 
Friday, June 6, 2014 
7:00 p.m. 

JERRY GRCEVICH TAMBURITZA ORCHESTRA 
Friday, August 1, 2014 
7:00 p.m. 

SEAN JONES QUARTET 
Friday, September 5, 2014 
7:00 p.m. 

Sadly, you've already missed the first concert on June 6th but still have time to check out the other two. Though they start at 7pm, I recommend arriving earlier, or at least having some people in your group arrive earlier, to save some space for everyone. Also, make sure to have $5 (or more) on hand to give at the entrance for the recommended donation.

Even though the music is important (thanks to Meeting of Important People for putting on a great show on Friday night), I think that friends and food really make this event. My husband and I met 8 friends and had a great time chatting and laughing and catching up on life. This is the sort of concert that it's OK to talk through. Then, the food -- you can't forget the food. Our group had fruit and cheese and wine and spring rolls and mac & cheese and dessert and on and on. Having an elaborate picnic style dinner in a beautiful space while listening to music just feels like such a magical movie moment. I'm already counting down the days to the August concert!",0,XWLtYPhCpHht5Zn52zp3-Q,0,5,2014-06-08,review,0

I liked the fact that you could walk through the house and most of the rooms. Nothing is behind glass so you can see things up close. All the ladies were nice and knew a lot about the history and answered all questions.

Although half of me is insanely envious of the lavish and exclusive lifestyle, I am grateful they preserved it so that I could have the privilege to walk through such Victorian art, value, and elegance. 

I am becoming a bit of a SWPA gilded age history nerd and will always be fascinated hearing their story no matter how many times because I WILL keep going back. 

My most recent visit was in early December and it was very nice. I didn't know this but they change the theme of the tour during the holiday season. The original tour is my favorite, but was nice having known the  background with a surprise addition learning the Frick family's holiday traditions.

The property has other buildings where you can do a tour, but we only went into the main one. As we walked in, there was a rotunda in the middle with tapestries hanging just around the walls. There was a nice lady by the door who explained what was where and how we could get to the other places to view art/house. She was incredibly informative. I definitely loved the exhibit and would recommend checking online for other features.

bhZ13wN_5lQrKX278AP_aw,fL70MArmKee2VcS0H8Ljgw,"I have spent significantly more time at the Frick Art & Historical Center than I knew was possible this year.  I have written more papers and stared at the 990s for hours.  The Frick is a pretty healthy museum in the financial sense, and they have made and are planning to make a ton of new additions.

The museum and house tour are amazing.  They are beautifully maintained.  The museum is fairly small, four or five rooms.  The paintings are not the most famous by any stretch, but it is still cool to see some originals.  The best part?  It's free!

The house tour is my preference and certain days of the year it is free, though I am not sure exactly which ones.  If you are from out of town, this reminds me of a smaller version of the Isabelle Stewart Gardner Museum in Boston but on a slightly smaller scale, house-wise.  However, the grounds here probably trump the Gardner Museum.  The Model T house is currently under renovations, but you can still check out the bowling alley and gardens!  Even cooler, they use foods and herbs grown in the garden at the newly-renovated Frick Cafe, I hear.

There is also a very small free parking lot.  It is best to get here early if you want to utilize that, but there is some street parking as well.  Not on a major bus line.

The Frick is a super cool place, and for a mid-sized city, this is a true gem!",4,XWLtYPhCpHht5Zn52zp3-Q,2,4,2015-05-24,review,3

There were lawn toys set out for kids to play with, twinkle lights strung throughout the space and a cool mix of music playing on the speakers. Nobody greeted us, despite seeing several employees at the entrance. But we still enjoyed every bit of the evening. There were a few food trucks at the entrance, but we packed our own dinner instead. It's nice to have the option though. And another option is the on-site restaurant. 

I'm looking forward to returning with a larger group for another Friday and hopefully for one of the First Friday's when there is live music.",0,XWLtYPhCpHht5Zn52zp3-Q,0,4,2015-07-17,review,0
5_GNc6DHiOOSH47ZjmOG_Q,b554TP79P9xN66LLkjWIsw,"While I don't believe you could spend an entire day at the Frick, you can easily spend a couple of hours especially if you are touring Clayton, which is about an hour tour. Admission is required for the tour, but it is free to visit the gardens and the Frick museum. Clayton epitomizes the opulence of the Gilded Age-make sure to check out the Playhouse on the way to Clayton as it is the size of a small house! Start your experience in the Grable Visitor Center. Here you can purchase admission to tour Clayton and browse their museum shop which has many interesting books about the history of Pittsburgh. 

Clayton was home to the Frick family from 1883-1905 and is quite well preserved. No photographs are allowed-just an FYI. Touring is only available for the first and second floors, however, you get to see the bedrooms, the kitchen, the library, and the calling room, in addition to the servants quarters. While Frick was an extensive art collector, most of his work is displayed in New York. The family home contains many paintings of the family though. The Frick Art Museum has some of his collection and typically has a rotating exhibit as well. The car and carriage museum is an interesting step back in time as well with items ranging from old Lincolns and Rolls Royces to a winter sleigh. Photos are allowed in this area. There is also a cafe, which I hear is quite nice, however, it is also quite hard to get into and reservations are a must. I highly recommend visiting for the holidays as they attempt to redecorate the home as the Fricks did at the turn of the century. The tree is beautifully decorated this time of year and worth viewing. Also of note, there is a parking lot so be sure to take advantage of the free parking.",0,XWLtYPhCpHht5Zn52zp3-Q,0,4,2015-11-30,review,1
9HCfCmd0t5GErgm7He6AeQ,G0l6y-n556kICMNZrO2mcQ,"This was my first time visiting here and not only did I want to see it's temporary exhibit ""Killer heels"" but also tour the rest of the grounds. I purchased a membership which entitles me to a free tour of the Clayton house. All I needed to do was go to the visitor's center and sign up for one. Although the museum itself is free if you are not a member then you pay a fee for this tour and also a separate fee to see Killer Heels. I didn't have to pay for that exhibit either since I had purchased a membership. The membership also entitles you to 10% off in both the gift shop and if you dine at the cafe.

They do offer student discounts whether you are in high school or college as well as senior citizen discounts should you choose not to buy a membership. I arrived when it opened and really immersed myself in the Killer Heels exhibit. It was indeed fascinating and very interesting. They do offer some videos. Parent advisory is noted on some of them before entering due to mature elements. I went to the visitor's center and got on an early afternoon tour of the Clayton house which was the home of the Frick family before they moved to NY.

I got to see the carriage house which was very interesting along with the greenhouse which I learned is modeled after Phipps conservatory. They were selling some herbs for Pittsburgh plus but I wasn't interested. The carriage house showed the evolution from the horse drawn carriages in the late 1800s to the first automobiles including the ""Stanley steamer.""

My tour of the Clayton house was by far outstanding!  They do have specific rules however. No photography is allowed in the mansion and you are not permitted to touch anything. Each room has a ""chair"" where one can sit if you get tired. Also no drinks are allowed. The tour encompasses both the first and second floor of mansion. The upper floor was the servants quarters and is off limits to the public.

The grounds are quiet beautiful and they are many areas where one can sit and relax and take in the natural beauty of the surroundings. By lunchtime this place was packed with people so I would recommend to arrive early. They have their own parking lot which is free and is easy accessible if you buy anything in the gift shop and want to throw it in your car.

Due to time constraints I was not able to visit the art museum itself but since I am a member will save it for a future visit. The people here are friendly and helpful and will gladly answer any questions you may have about the place and especially on tour. The art and architecture truly amazed me! That along with their special exhibit and my opportunity to dine there (the cafe is reviewed separately) made it a lovely day to see an area that was once part of the our ""Millionaire's row"" in Pittsburgh.

Looking forward to returning there to see the art gallery and take that Clayton house tour again. Would give 4 1/2 stars in my book.",6,XWLtYPhCpHht5Zn52zp3-Q,3,4,2016-06-21,review,6

Now what went wrong. The cut was good, but it certainly wasn't what I expected from a salon with the reputation of Izzazu. I wasn't bowled over by my stylist's professionalism either. Don't diss my previous stylist....she rocked....you don't do yourself any favors by knocking someone else.  (And come on, I was WAAAYYYY overdue for a cut since I've been driving to Cleveland for a style.)  That being said, for $55 (and saving big bucks on gas, tolls, lunch and shopping) the cut was still a deal. But, when I started to sign the charge slip, it said $65, not $55. ""But,"" I said, ""the website said it was $55 for a Master stylist."" ""Oh,"" the chick at the counter said, ""that's for Men's cuts."" Silly me. 

So when I got back to the office, I went online and checked. Nope, it said $55 for a Master Stylist WOMEN's haircut. Hmmmmm. So I called. The chick at the counter now said, ""Oh, our stylist's charge whatever they feel the cut SHOULD be."" What?????? So I quoted the prices to her from the Izzazu website. She changed her tune again. ""Oh, well.....I'll refund you $10 if you give me your credit card number."" Didn't she have my slip with the card number? ""Sorry, I don't give my credit card number over the phone."" ""Or I can send you a gift certificate."" ""Nope,"" I said through clenched teeth, ""I won't be coming back.""

It wasn't the cut. It was the bait and switch. I'd gladly have paid it had they been up front and above-board ahead of time. As Judge Judy says, ""Don't pee on my leg and tell me it's raining.""

I have to say that Emilio, the owner of Izzazu is the consumate professional when it comes to customer service and follow up.  After my first appointment - at that time to be my last appointment - he doggedly tried to contact me to make the first appointment right.  Emilio and I had quite a lengthly and productive conversation.  He cares very much about making the customer happy AND correcting the situation that was unsatisfactory.  

I did go back and was very pleased with my cut once again.  Because Marshall was running late (20 minutes and counting) Caesar cut my hair this time.  Another great cut!

Again, however, the desk needs training in customer service.  After a 20 minute wait, the receptionist still hadn't notified Marshall that I was there.   A downtown salon depends on clients who are on their lunch hours for the most part.  Next appointment I'll call ahead to see how they're running before heading to the salon and waiting.

The other problem I had was the price tag, or the surprise when I went to pay. $250.00 for a color correction!

I always got compliments on my hair after getting it cut.  As for price - their stylists are tiered and have different price scales.  I asked while on the phone making my appointment and had no surprises.  

After trying many salons that didn't make the cut (yay puns!) and ending up with bangs, mullets, and other horrible cuts, I am sticking with Izzazu.",0,cuuJJ9W3tYmidaLvlzvPBw,0,5,2011-03-14,review,1

Despite Emilio's assurances that changes were being made, my latest visit proved otherwise.  I called ahead and was assured that Marshall was on time...in fact, he didn't have an appointment ahead of mine and could take me as soon as I got there.  I was there a few minutes before my appointment.  I waited.  And waited.  Fifteen minutes later, I asked if Marshall knew I was waiting.  I was told by the brunette that they had been busy.  Odd, she, the blonde and two other employees had been standing there talking for a while.  She went back to notify Marshall.  When Marshall came up front to get me, the brunette admonished him that he should keep an eye out for his clients - she shouldn't have to notify him that his appointment is there.  Wow.  And the purpose of a receptionist is....what?  I'm done.  I'm out.  Apparently nothing will help Izzazu's but getting rid of the front desk staff.  

On a positive note, it was another great cut.  Not good enough to lure me back, though.",1,cuuJJ9W3tYmidaLvlzvPBw,1,1,2011-06-03,review,2

The only reason I didn't give four stars was the cost. Haricuts are 50 dollars with my stylist which is a bit pricey, but as I've learned, you get what you pay for. 

I have noticed complaints from other reviewers regarding coloring service, but I don't color, so I can't speak to that. 

Also, they are no longer located on the Blvd of the Allies - they are on 5th and wood now. The new salon space is very clean and beautiful.

The first time I went into him, I was 18 years old and had some crazy red, blond and black hair. He really helped me go back to my natural color without damaging my hair (even with color stripping!) 

He always knows exactly what I want, but isn't afraid to give me suggestions to liven up my look. He literally does the best color and cut in the city. And believe me, I've done some crazy stuff with my hair with a lot of hair dressers. 

The atmosphere is very hip/chic and makes me feel like a celebrity when I go there!

Also, I LOVE their product line. I still only use Izzazu leave-in conditioner, hairspray and dry shampoo, even while spending over half of my year away from Pittsburgh at school.

The loss of one star goes to the attitude at reception. I understand it has compelled people to give them 1 star, but it IS a salon, meant for cosmetic services.

MLZ9xHl8odrUaDbi1fzbAQ,DjrLOScw-7toMKHDfyHxqg,"In sum the service was great, both at the reception area and with the stylist. I was extremely please with the low-lights I requested as well as the hair cut and style. Let alone, the numerous compliments I received from others about my cut, color, and style.

I was admittedly skeptical of buying the Groupon I used yesterday [$65.00 off salon services], given the location that was closest to me was downtown. The address Yelp has listed is their old address. They are now located at 301 5th Ave and have been since October of 2010. My apprehension was due to the downtown location. Not so much parking per se, but loathing a pretentious salon atmosphere. Pittsburgh salons never seem to lack pretension and not surprisingly if you have read my other reviews pretension is something I could not abhor more. Nevertheless, the reception staff and my stylist were very courteous and service oriented. Thankfully, hoity-toity is not a word I could use to describe either of them.

As I have never been to an Izzazu salon before, nor have I asked my friends if they have either, I did not know which stylist to request. When I made my appointment I asked the woman, ""who would YOU want to color and cut YOUR hair?"" I was told Frank is an excellent stylist and had availability for the time I requested. 

Frank was knowledgeable, personable, and kind. He was meticulous and diligent about the low-light placements as well as making sure I have the proper amount of them. Too often, especially when using Groupons stylists hurry through placement and provide them sparsely. But this stylist did not forget the point of businesses choosing to provide Groupons. Provide excellent service, and those new customers will return! 

I've read one or two other reviews that commented on dirty bowls and a lack of sanitation. Perhaps I am not retentive enough to write a thorough review. I am not here to nit-pick businesses. Not to say that I did notice my color bowl, it resembled a normal color bowl not dirty or offensive by any means. Perhaps in the past they possessed such bowls and learned the errors of their ways. Or perhaps some people can never be pleased. All I can say, I was not worried about any sanitation concerns.

I highly recommend visiting this salon and requesting Frank. Nuff said.",0,cuuJJ9W3tYmidaLvlzvPBw,0,4,2012-01-04,review,1

We were looking forward to a relaxing, fun experience. More unbelievable, I waited 20 minutes to pay for the two services. One receptionist couldn't take transactions and another was occupied with a wedding party.  I was so close to walking out and not paying. Unfortunately the two stylists didn't get a tip through no fault of their own. I can't give an unbiased opinion of their work as I am still furious in the way I was treated.

They could have been a bit more generous. We ordered the Miaetta hoagie which was pretty much like a club. Once again, good but nothing to write home about.

sS2sSWqZMnQMRoWx-Mdzgg,C9p5UvH_DkdRjrl61H-xcQ,"Considering my absolute love for sweets - and more specifically, ice cream - it just doesn't make sense that it took me nearly 6 years of living in Pittsburgh to go to Page Dairy Mart. The only bad thing is that it's too close to where we live, so I can expect my sugar intake to go through the roof now.

As you walk up, it's easy to be overwhelmed by the signage and menu, as they seem to have everything that you could ever imagine. In fact, you might just be better off walking up and ordering whatever you want without looking at the menu. Odds are, they'll just smile and run off to make it. I mean, if they have toasted coconut soft serve ice cream, what don't they have, right?

The people that work there are all really pleasant and the ice cream is excellent! It is cash only, so that might be a downside if you're just randomly stopping by for the first time, but it's one place where the long lines are truly warranted in this town. Don't worry, though, usually the line isn't actually long at all. They take your order quickly at Page and your order will actually be up impressively fast for the amount of people ordering thanks to Page Dairy Mart's army of ice cream servers on staff. That ""line"" of people will disappear as quickly as a new one appears.

A night hasn't gone by since our first visit that my wife and I haven't wanted to go back. Only our conscious willpower has kept us away, and there aren't a lot of places that have left me feeling that way, so kudos to Page Dairy Mart and their staff!

What I can say is that the yogurt was smooth and creamy and I LOVE that they have a ton of flavors they can ""mix into"" the yogurt so you can get almost any flavor you want.  Hubby had a cone of regular soft serve ice cream and said it was really yummy.  He also had an order of cheese sticks and said they were just o.k., so we will probably stick to ice cream/frozen yogurt from this place.

No more words needed to be said between us.  The decision was silently made that we'd head down Carson Street and there as no stopping us!

I mean, let's get real... this thing is monster size!  You can easily split it BUT... I could EASILY gobble that whole thing down in one sitting!

Turns out Page Dairy Mart has been in the same location for about a hundred years. It was a gas station for a long time, it was a service station, they had a farm stand in there for a number of years and it was twice slammed by flood waters from the nearby Monongahela river.

I don't know if I would say that Page's has particularly superior soft serve, but it's the experience and variety that makes this a four star place. I do think the ice cream is better than somewhere like Dairy Queen, but not by much. What makes Page's special is wide variety of options and soft serve flavors.

Although I've yet to make a dent in the full menu, I recommend going for a classic on your first trip: a vanilla cone covered with jimmies. While the ice cream is tasty (more so than similar chain ice cream shops throughout the city), the main appeal is the offbeat location and the celebratory camaraderie of the crowded parking lot during those long summer nights.

Page's has been a regular family outing as far back as I can remember and clearly the popularity doesn't stop with just my family. From opening day to closing you will find people willing to line up around the block to get their ice cream fix.

No other ice cream location in Pittsburgh even comes close to rivaling this outstanding soft serve experience. Our usual order consists of the basics: swirled soft serve (cup or cone) dipped in crunches or jimmies.

Not only do they have soft serve but also a wide variety of insane sundae creations and other novelties. And don't forget about the shaved ice - which comes in basically ever flavor you could imagine.

I ordered a small Chocolate Chip ice cream with rainbow sprinkles and my boyfriend ordered the Strawberry Shortcake sundae. My Chocolate Chip ice cream tasted identical to Breyer's boxed ice cream from the grocery store. I may have ordered the wrong item but because it is soft-serve ice cream they don't offer samples. My boyfriend had the Strawberry Shortcake sundae which had 3 pieces of cake on the bottom, 2 scoops of vanilla ice cream, strawberry syrup, strawberries (not fresh), almonds and whipped cream. It was huge and they didn't allow him to swap flavors or make any adjustments.

Ice cream is soft serve and is your pretty standard good ice cream: creamy, soft, cold, with authentic flavors. It's delicious. But honestly, good ice cream can be found in many places in Pittsburgh.

So what makes this place stand out from all the other ice cream places in Pittsburgh is the fact that they have delicious sundaes. My favorite is the cookie sundae, which has fresh-out-of-the-oven-melt-in-your-mouth cookies on top of a mountain of ice cream and hot fudge. They use Nancy B's bakery cookies. Yum.

It's a tiny little place (window service only) on a random corner underneath an overpass. But don't let the appearance and location fool you; you will not leave disappointed.

A personal favorite of mine is the chocolate chip cookie sundae. It's made with one of Nancy B's chocolate cookies (hands down one of the best cookies in existence--in college I worked for a coffee shop that sold these, and we would literally rejoice when one broke in half because that meant we couldn't sell it and would get to eat it). Anyway, the cookie is warmed up and served atop vanilla soft-serve ice cream with hot fudge and whipped cream.

After enjoying our ice cream, we went to get in the car to drive home and it would NOT start. It just wasn't happening.

Every time I enter this lackluster (and may I add DIRTY) location, there is a 50/50 chance of the following: a) that the store will only be about half stocked, or b) that their stock order has arrived, meaning that you now have the pleasure of tripping over pallets and large dollies full of unopened stock boxes everywhere (which includes right in the middle of the aisles).

The regular cashiers are rude or flat out gross (one time the cashier was ""joking"" about killing herself as she was ringing out customers). The only employees that treat you decently are the ones that I notice have been there for years. The neighborhood itself is in disarray but I find that a poor excuse for this Family Dollar location to continuously be in such poor condition, as there is a Rite Aid RIGHT NEXT DOOR to this location that treats itself with respect and dignity.

I am forced to keep visiting this cesspool of a Family Dollar location solely out of convenience.

I had a dinner party there in the summer and have another one planned in March and Jonathan totally goes the extra effort to make it special.  He arranged for a dj last time, so we were able to dance off some of his food.  Okay, the food is great.  I especially recommend the Veal Chop.  The staff is awesome. I really like Marney and Errol (two main servers) and I like Jordan the bartender upstairs (Marney's daughter).  I'd like to give this place 5 stars, but it has a few smaller problems.  It's a little bit pricey.  The good is that the cost does include salad, pasta, and bread, but the bad is that you'll easily spend $50 on an entree.  The Veal Chop is $65.  That's a little much, especially considering the location.  The dishes also which are delicious are simply toooooo big.  I mean literally you can three meals out of one entree,  I would suggest some smaller plates especially for the bar.  One last tip, even though it's not BYOB anymore, you can still BYOB.

Next he sauté them in olive oil, added brown sugar, brandy, raisins, and finished it with heavy cream. They were fantastic. There were a variety of specials including wild boar chops, a risotto with prawns, scallops, and black truffles. But I chose the dry aged filet with lump crab in a leek cream. It was the best piece of filet I've ever had. It was easily a pound of beef and a half pound of crab in a light cream sauce with leeks. I could barely touch it after the pasta, salad, bread, and appetizers. I brought my leftovers home and have them another time. Dessert consisted of a nice portion of carrot cake with an apricot cream cheese icing with apricot jam filling. It was a nice take on an old favorite.

BbfGr5eTdW-I-9KI5KN0ag,eT1LP7q0vz5F8ffPBqPtGw,"Some people train for marathons, other people train for this meal. Before sitting down make sure you get in the proper state of mind and prepare yourself for a long night of indulgence. This being my first dining experience at Alla Famiglia, I was unaware of the challenge that I had undertaken. We had A Party of Five, empty bellies and an optimistic mentality; we couldn't resist the tempting appetizers recited to us and ended up ordering the mega meatball, calamari and shrimp, and sausage over polenta. All were amazing. The meatball was the highlight: twelve ounces of perfectly cooked beef, filled with mozzarella and covered in sauce and provolone (kisses fingers). Big plus for including the tentacles in the calamari. I've noticed these legs less and less while dining out, when did they lose suction as a staple of a calamari appetizer? Also adorning our table were a few clothing options in which to dress the bread, all of them enjoyable on their own or as an ensemble.

One would think after such a hearty opener all that remained was the main course. How wrong of an assumption that turned out to be. Before we could even think about crushing our dinners, we had to face two formidable courses of salad and pasta. As mentioned by other reviewers, the salad is great. Nice dressing, nice fillers, nice roughage. The pasta that's included with the entree was a fusilli bucati in a vodka sauce served family style. Unable to pass up the promise of a great carbonara with guanciale and fresh egg, we had two pasta opponents to tackle. Both were cooked so perfectly al dente I would have put them on my NHL all-star ballot as a write-in if voting hadn't already closed.

At this point in the meal, I had completely forgotten that I still hadn't even seen my main course. And I was fine with that. As a table we compiled quite the culinary collection: bistecca fiorentina, veal milanese, veal marsala, mussels in a diavola sauce and the sea bass special for the evening. You know when a meal is so utterly divine that you just stop talking to everyone around you and have a one on one pow wow with the gastro-gods? Yeah, that's what happened. I will say at one point during the meal, my brother had to get up and take a walk around the restaurant for fear he would wake up two days later in the ICU if he didn't fight off the impending food coma that threatened his existence. Instead of napkins they should have given us a white towel and a trainer to throw it on the table for us because we were doing our best impression of Apollo Creed...and our food was Ivan Drago.

Our waiter, who we thought was our friend, then had the nerve to ask if we wanted dessert, some balls on that guy. Of course we wanted dessert. We decided on the tiramisu which I hope had a clean bill of health because it blew our minds. It was so good that I was upset with myself. I did exactly what I hate seeing someone do on any and every food network show. I took a bite, put down my fork, closed my eyes and just said, ""wow!"" I just hope it was as good for the tiramisu.

Other housekeeping items: you can bring your own wine for which they charge a corking fee. All the water is bottled, but I didn't see it on the bill so I figure it's included. The chef/owner is extremely friendly and accessible, as he is cooking basically right next to your table. Parking at the meters next to the building is free after 6pm, despite what it says on the signs; our waiter informed us they have an unspoken agreement with the parking authority.

They take everything in stride. Things start with fresh bread, a small dish of olives and the Holy oil....better love garlic!

Appetizer....a tasty softball-sized meatball with mozzarella in a nicely spiced red sauce. Not your average hamburger meatball...this is a work of art...perfectly seasoned, juicy and delicious.

Salad....wow! Crisp greens, olives, peppers, Gorgonzola with a red wine based vinaigrette...couldn't stop eating it.

Pasta course....opted for both house pastas....the first was the oft mentioned linguine tossed in the wheel of Romano with cream and black pepper. Served table side with a bottle of deliciously spicy oil. Second was the curly pasta tossed in the signature vodka sauce! The pasta was spot on cooked...not a soggy noodle in sight. The preparations were executed to perfection.

Entrees...veal Milanese...this is a beautiful double chop, ""paddled"" into tenderness, dredged in house made bread crumbs, tossed with pine nuts and cooked to perfection. If you can only order one thing here...this is it! We also had the filet of beef in Gorgonzola cream...medium rare, tender, well seasoned...rich, decadent and incredible.

Dessert....yes...we forced ourselves...homemade cannoli and a variant of tiramisu with toasted/burnt almond slivers and raspberries. Tiramisu was delectable...light, balanced and very flavorful.

Haven't really added much to the raves from previous patrons...just had to chime in our hearty AMEN of agreement. Love everything about this place. Thank you Jonathan...and all of your staff for an awesome dining experience.",2,qUeBDN0D8SC93KeAHhiL-g,2,5,2012-09-11,review,5
nEYPahVwXGD2Pjvgkm7QqQ,T2vaDjAoka8tTEfiZdlopA,"FACT: Thee best Italian meal I've had in the Burgh, hands down!
FACT: I ate so much I thought they would have to wheel me out on a stretcher.
FACT: It's a serious hidden gem in a slightly sketchy neighborhood.

Need some more info, because I'm comin' atcha with the goods! To start they set the table with ""Holy Oil,"" which is banana pepper olive oil for dipping Italian bread in, a seasoned cecci bean and cheese gustoso and a goat cheese and olive spread. I wish they sold that banana pepper olive oil because I wanted to have it every day of my life! 

We ordered the famous Meatball appetizer. This meatball is for serious! It's massive and stuffed with mozzarella cheese. Yep, I'm for realz. It was just oozing Italian sexiness, in a ball. As soon as I tasted the red sauce, it tasted like my Grandma's, which sparked fond memories and made me want to actually live in this place. 

We also ordered the Trifolata, which is assorted mushrooms and currants in marsala cream. It was also incredible. The bad/good of it was that it wasn't really needed because they give you so much food, but it was delicious, so whatever!

For the Third course they serve you your choice of pasta either with their famous home made vodka sauce or fettucini. But here's the thing, the fettucini is made in front of you... in a cheese wheel. Yep, I'm for realz again! I know I'm crazy for not ordering it, but I really love me some vodka sauce and was incredibly happy with this amazing homemade sauce. My hubby got the fetticini and loved it. See, we're all happy here!

Fourth course is a salad with red vinagariette, roasted red peppers, candied walnuts, golden raisens and gargonzola cheese. It wasn't memorable amongst all the bangin' dishes but not too shabby at all.

For the Fifth course (and when I finally tapped out) I ordered the Cioppino with shrimp, mussels, clams, scallops and fish in a saffron and tomato broth with sambuca. It matched all the other dishes. Just incredible. Loved the broth, loved the succulent scallop (just one, but I can't complain, I was stuffed by that point!), the shrimp was jumbo and the fish was perfectly cooked. And the garlic bread was excellent.

Whenever anyone says things are expensive, I usually think they're talking $30 a plate. But, this place is legit expensive. Think $50 (ish) a plate. But what I can tell you is it was 100% worth it! We had leftovers for two days! Talk about an Italian hospitality. Which, by the way, the service was exceptional, but I would have expected that here. 

A perfect special night out, if you don't mind unbuckling a couple notches in front of your dining companion, of course!",6,qUeBDN0D8SC93KeAHhiL-g,5,5,2012-09-25,review,18

Chef Jonathan is a genius - his ""Veal Chop Milanese"" with lump crab, toasted pine nuts, and lemon is the BEST I've ever had.  Every time we eat here, my husband orders this dish and refuses to try anything else - that's how AMAZING it is.  

I have tried a variety of entrees - everything from the the Veal Chop Pizzaiolo to the Steak il pizzaiolo to the Medallions of veal Pomodoro ai Pepperoni.  Each dish is infused with deliciousness that makes these entrees OUT OF THIS WORLD!  

You have got to try the following:  mozzarella (apptz), hot peppers (apptz), mozzarella stuffed meatball (apptz), vodka pasta (automatically received with your meal - sauce is delicious), veal chop milanese (entrée).  

You won't be disappointed - the kitchen is open so you can even watch as Chef Jonathan prepares your dinner.  

Make a reservation.  Neighborhood is a bit sketchy so be careful.  

PS.  I've taken all my friends, family, and business partners (many who do not live in Pittsburgh) here and everyone absolutely loves it and wishes they lived in Pitt so they could come here more often.  In fact, we no longer live in Pittsburgh, but every time we come into town for a visit, we HAVE to eat dinner at our favorite Alla Famiglia!",1,qUeBDN0D8SC93KeAHhiL-g,1,5,2012-11-07,review,2

Could not have asked for more than what we got tonight at Alla Famiglia.  Service was very good, helpful and friendly.  The right balance of being there without dominating the table.

Food was top notch.  My only complaint would be that there was too much of it !  

The Lamb Chops were fantastic. Our kids shared a serve and they had to fight us off.  I had the House Specialty, "" Veal Chop Milanese""  and was very impressed.

Hard to fault any of the food actually.  From the bread and Holy Oil that starts the meal, through the appetizers, the salad and the pasta, on to the mains.  Everything was stunning.

mY080Juh7DTkvLQJSJS1Pw,qgiwEQ61YRtBZouVaW0vgQ,"This is my favorite restaurant in the world. I love it substantially more than any Italian restaurant I have frequented in Italy. If there's a special occasion to celebrate, it's done here, no questions asked. Everything on the menu is phenomenal, and the service is phenomenal as well. The restaurant itself is very intimate and cozy and there is valet available, so the fact that it's in a sketchy neighborhood matters not. The bar upstairs is nice, but dining downstairs is something else, as you can watch your food being prepared. Make sure you visit on an empty stomach, as you will be served multiple courses! The vodka pasta you are given is AMAZING. You also get salad and bread with two dips/oil. Entrees are well-sized and you'll probably have the leftovers ever after gorging on all of the mini meals that come before the entree. I do not eat beef... until i go to alla famiglia and order the meatball appetizer. That's saying something, so don't forget to order it. My mum gets some hunk of beef (sorry, I don't even really look at beef/pork options) every time we go and I can hear her making moaning noises as she chews, and then she talks about how to die for it was afterward. I usually get a seafood dish, whatever it may be at the time, and it is always one of the greatest things I have and will ever eat. I want my final meal to be from Alla Famiglia. Please.

QDK6bWO18Rwye2fKahr-sg,83uw4zMzhjvL8iisvjjYog,"After a friend told me about her wonderful experience here, I knew I had to go. I also knew that it wasn't really in my budget. Well, lucky for me an old college friend of mine decided that he was coming to town for a visit. I sent him the websites for various restaurants and when he saw Alla Famiglia he said, ""Oh honey. Make the reservation - I've got it.""  YES! I knew I kept him around for some reason!

So on a cold, snowy Saturday night, we trudged up the mountain. And it was glorious.

First off, it IS in a bit of a sketchy neighborhood. But no worries - they have valet, so you don't have to deal with trying to find somewhere to park and walking around.

The Holy Oil is the best thing I've ever dipped bread into - and I'm a dipper. I come from an Italian family - we dip everything into everything - bread into sauce, cookies into coffee, bread into coffee, etc. This is by far the best dipping experience I've ever had.

Onto the MEATBALL. We got the mozzarella-stuffed meatball for our appetizer. The meatball was good. The sauce was great. There isn't much more I can say about it, to be honest. It was just so, so yummy.

Salad course: Great salad!

Pasta course: So, I was slightly disappointed that they did not give us a choice. I was really looking forward to the fettuccine in the cheese wheel that I had read about here! Alas, only vodka sauce. Great vodka sauce, though. I should've asked about that damn cheese wheel...

For the main course, I got the veal chop milanese and it was perfect. My friend got the cioppino and he enjoyed that very much.

I could not even think about eating dessert. We had so much food. I took 1/2 of my pasta course and 3/4 of my main course home. I really wish I had gotten a dessert to go and eaten it later, though. 

I really cannot wait to go again.",3,qUeBDN0D8SC93KeAHhiL-g,2,5,2013-02-13,review,5

Some of the best Italian food I have had in my life. Everything feels authentic, straight from Italy, and family owned. 

Where to begin? Well the appetizer selection is incredible, my favorite being the provolone fried in truffle oil. The stuffed banana peppers were to die for, and I have had many others that were spectacular.

For the entree, I have had both the veal chop and the filet. The veal chop is almost as large as my arm (not joking) and was delicious, prepared either of their two signature ways. For the filet, I do not like gorgonzola so I asked them to prepare it a different way (which they are very willing to do and usually announce to the table at the beginning of the meal). It was done is a mushroom sauce that was a perfect compliment to the perfectly cooked filet.

Finally, do not forget to save room for dessert (which will be fairly difficult considering the sheer volume of food that they give you). The tiramisu is amazing, and I would highly recommend trying their gelato. 

In short, my favorite restaurant in Pittsburgh. I would highly recommend a visit, especially with a large group. Reservations help, but not usually required.",1,qUeBDN0D8SC93KeAHhiL-g,0,5,2013-06-18,review,1

My wife and I dined at Alla Famiglia last night, and we were both blown away.  It was our first time here so we went with our waiter's suggestions from start to finish.


After snacking on the ridiculously delicious 'Holy Oil', we started with a couple apps -  Greens and Beans, and the Meatball; both were incredible.  Braised endive, house sausage, and tender white beans seasoned to perfection, and a meatball the size of your fist.

Before our entrees were brought out, we were each brought a salad and pasta course.  The fresh made pasta was served with the best vodka sauce I have ever had -   amazing.

On to the entrees;  I got the Veal Chop Pizzaiolo and my wife got the Coteletta Del Monzu.  Spectacular.   Both the veal chop and the cutlet melted in our mouths.

All in all, after a couple apps, two entrees, a bottle of wine and a couple cocktails, we got out for about $260 after tip.  That said, I've eaten at some amazing restaurants in my time, and I can say with confidence that last night's dinner is easily one of the top 5 meals I've had in my lifetime.  I can't wait to find an excuse to go back.

Well done, Alla Famiglia.


Update:  Visits 2 and 3 to Alla Famiglia were just as spectacular as the first.  My wife and I have ordered something different each time we've visited, and normally I'd say something like 'we haven't been disappointed'.  However, that would be an egregious understatement.  Every visit to this wonderful restaurant has been nothing short of  astonishing.  The food is truly breathtaking, and the service is top notch.

In my humble opinion, this is without question the best restaurant in Pittsburgh.


Update 2:  As you can see by the number of check-ins I have here, we find every excuse we can to continue to come here.  It is still the best restaurant in the 'Burgh.",0,qUeBDN0D8SC93KeAHhiL-g,0,5,2013-07-18,review,3
cwqUjIiUhXK8CFVdb9vAbw,KVGBSV1qhdaiQzH20vTl5g,"While visiting the Pittsburgh area, my wife and I were intrigued by the excellent reviews we found of Alla Familgia.  While it was a bit of a drive from Cranberry Township, we needed a dining reprieve after a disappointing visit at BRAVO! Cucina Italiana.  East Warrington Avenue is undergoing major construction which made finding parking a bit difficult, fortunately there is valet service in a lot to the side of the restaurant which we took advantage of.  
Upon entering, we were warmly welcomed by the host.  We visited on a stormy evening and were fortunate to find that some reservations had been cancelled due to the weather, which enabled us to get a table.  I strongly advise to get reservations in advance.  We were seated on the first floor with a view of the chefs cooking.  Awesome.
All that has been said in prior reviews, I heartily agree with.  The bread, cheese, and dipping oil was a delicious start.  Ingredients were fresh.  The pasta and main course dishes were done perfectly.  My wife had the Gorgonzola Filet Mignon, which she described as one of the best meals she has ever eaten.

Bkz60FHM-GKGcssW8ff5QQ,LNk_N6Ed6NGm9MFIdmLJLw,"Let's just start with the elephant in the room...picture a vintage Arnold Schwarzenegger flexing his biceps in the mirror. This is the framed ""art"" inside the women's restroom located on the 2nd floor. Odd. I nearly poked my eyes out with my mascara brush from staring. It's hypnotizing.

Now that we got that out of the way, let's talk about  the restaurant!

After months of whining, a group of 8 of us finally decided to nut up or shut up and finally made plans. (Thank you, Samantha B. for organizing!)

Getting a reservation for 8 is not an easy task. The building is a three-story, traditional townhouse  that is very narrow leaving only so much space inside for the dining area, bar, and the kitchen. And, it is located in the middle of Allentown. Yes, Allentown. This fact could qualify as the baby elephant in the room but it seems to be the trend to operate fantastic restaurants in areas that would make your average xenophobe from suburbia go bat shit cray cray.  And, for the record, I'm not drinking Hatorade. I was equally ""scurred""  during the drive up E. Warrington Avenue...and I live in the East End where hipsters and old school hippies are known to reside and give peace a chance. 

The reality is what it is. It's a scary part of town but it did not matter a damn when we got out of the car. It was a Saturday night and we were greeted by an average Joe  valet who sincerely welcomed us to the restaurant  and told us to enjoy our dinner. The locals who walked by smiled and nodded as if they were giving us their approval. It's as if the restaurant was under a dome, protected by a force field that doesn't allow the stereotypical nonsense most would fear when entering Allentown at night. 

We were greeted by our server who immediately took our drink orders. I didn't see a bar on the first floor so I almost hesitated to order my usual dirty martini and my sweetheart's Manhattan, thinking they were limited in their mixology. Orders were taken without pause and both drinks were most impressive. Our friends enjoyed vino rossos and biancos from their diverse wine list that is 100% Italia! 

Tables are set with ""Holy Oil"" for dipping artisanal Italian breads, a seasoned cheese and cecci bean gustoso, and, my favorite, a fresh goat cheese olive spread.

We started with the artichoke appetizer special and shared the meatball appetizer with the rest of the table. Yes, shared. The meatball is bigger than Barry Bonds and Kanye West's egos combined. And, it was friggin' fantastic. The flavors, the marinara sauce, the mozzarella stuffed inside...If I could marry a meatball, this would be matrimonial bliss.

My sweetheart chose the highly recommended veal chop Milanese. This is yet another piece of meat listed on the menu not small in size. Because I am always the a-hole of the group, I asked if I could have Linguine and Clam sauce instead of the pasta prep on the menu. Again, no hesitation. Wow. But the groans from my our table makes me still an a-hole. I DON'T CARE! IT WAS MY CARB DAY DAMNIT! :-)

Our entrees did not disappoint. TASTY!!!! The entrees minus the pasta came with salad and pasta side served family style. Lots of food to be shared.

We finished with the hand-spun espresso gelato. Others at the table went for other gelato flavors and the Tiramisu. We all had spoons to share. All were ""delish"".

I was tempted to order the other highly recommended entree, the Cowboy Steak Diane. My friend Beth had the pleasure. The wild mushrooms on her dish looked just as big as the meatballs and she raved about the Worcestershire butter. She offered me a sample but I was too full and ready to birth my food baby.

Oh yeah. How could I forget! Franco Harris walked in. SHUT UP!!! Not entirely surprising after viewing the wall on the second floor covered with photos of VIPs posing with the chef/owner. 

It's great to see a gem in Allentown that can shine a light on the other diamonds in the ruff in that area. But don't let  the neighborhood fool you. This restaurant is VERY high end in service, cuisine, price, and atmosphere.

kWkgwRxqWD-h260dMTkHUA,GCb2T50KWDE0_xnXjQwzhA,"I stopped by here this past Thursday with my fiance and 4 other dining companions for dinner.  Alla Famiglia has been on my list of places to try for quite a long time and I was eagerly anticipating eating a dinner here.  We arrived shortly before our reservation time of 7:30 at about the same time as another couple from our party. We were almost immediately taken back to our table which was on the first floor in a back room.  I honestly didn't notice too much while we were walking back to our table but thought there was not much decoration in the room we were in.  Yes there was a fireplace but nothing else really sticks out besides the fact that the lights would dim a bit for about 5 seconds before eventually brightening back up every 10 minutes or so.

Since none of our party had ever been to Alla Famiglia before our server took the time to go over the menu with us.  Whenever he got to the veal chop and explained it was their specialty, I immediately knew that was what I wanted.  So I ended up ordering that with the pizzaiolo option while my fiance went with the seafood diavolo.  My veal chop was described as a double cut natural chop braised with hot and sweet peppers, homemade Italian sausage, and plum tomatoes while my fiances seafood diavola had many different types of seafood in it including a lobster tail.  All entrees also come with a first course of salad and a second course of pasta with vodka sauce, both served family style.  While we were waiting for our first course to come out they served us some crusty Italian bread along with a couple of different dipping sauces of which I remember one that had a couple of different imported cheeses, one with goat cheese and then another which was olive oil based and called the holy oil(?) due to a trio of herbs of which one was basil.  That one was my favorite and when combined with some of the Parmesan cheese that they had on the table was awesome.  After a short while our salads came out, 2 family style bowls for the 6 of us along with a dish of Gorgonzola so that we could top our salads with it.  The salad ended up tasting decent, I only wish that I had more of it.  The six of us quickly finished it all and then were in for quite a bit of a wait before our pasta with vodka sauce arrived.  It was long enough for all of us to notice and wonder what was taking so long for pasta.  Whenever it arrived, once again 2 family style bowls for the 6 of us, I thought that it tasted pretty good.  It wasn't the best vodka sauce I have ever tasted but since I was still pretty hungry at this point I really enjoyed it especially after adding some of the chili oil that they brought to the table with it.  The chili oil gave the sauce that perfect bite for me.  Almost immediately after finishing our pasta our dinner entrees arrived.  My veal chop looked impressive and was big enough to make comments about how it could tip the car on the Flintstones.  Most of that was due to the size of the bone although there was a decent amount of meat on it.  The veal itself was cooked perfectly as it was moist and juicy and I  ended up enjoying it. The pizzaiolo sauce was just ok though as some of the sausage that I had seemed to be burnt while others were fine.  Whenever I had the non burnt pieces I liked it but the couple of burnt pieces really made the sauce inconsistent from bite to bite.  I was also lucky enough to try some of my wonderful fiances lobster tail and thought that it was very good.  It was cooked perfectly and was tender and tasty while not being overdone at all.  After all that we had eaten our whole table ended up passing on dessert and I left the restaurant full but not overly so.  I am still wondering about all of these reviews that tell you how much food they received which was also said by the valet on the way in.  It made me wonder do they normally serve a family style portion to two people instead of the three like they did at our table?  Should I feel cheated on this one?  Maybe I will find out on a future visit but then again maybe I will not.

The bottom line for me is that I might come back here again in the future but I don't think that this would be my first choice.  Don't get me wrong, the food here was pretty good but whenever my food bill after tip is coming out to about $150, they had better either have impeccable service like the Capital Grille or Ruth Chris' or to die for food.  Sadly Alla Famiglia let me down on both accounts here as the food was good and the service average.",0,qUeBDN0D8SC93KeAHhiL-g,0,4,2013-10-02,review,3
f9LuLzqLMNJJoV3zmu6dBA,DccaQ26Y6UR4FGwWGKPSLA,"After hearing about AF and reading the reviews, I was expecting an amazing experience. We made reservations weeks in advance and I counted down the days. Finally, D day arrived. We arrived and quickly valeted the car. I would definitely suggest you valet. The neighborhood seemed a bit sketchy. Into the restaurant I happily galloped. What a cute little place. Open kitchen in the first room. We sat in the second room. Homey, old school Italian feel. The server explained the menu and took our drink order. Hubs and I split a bottle of wine. Nothing better than a good bottle of red wine with a hearty Italian meal. 

We were ready to eat. I dug into the bread on the table and thoroughly enjoyed the holy oil dip. So much so that I didn't even bother with the other two spreads. The menu was very veal heavy. I guess that's their specialty but not what I was looking for. I chose the filet gorgonzola. Our first course was salad. Served family style this salad was savory and sweet with raisins and gorgonzola on the side. Then we waited, and waited and waited. They are definitely not in a rush here. The next course was pasta with vodka sauce. After reading the reviews, I was a little disappointed that we were not offered the alfredo cheese wheel as an option. The vodka sauce was lacking flavor for me. I added a little chili oil and it brightened up some. Again we waited and waited. Finally, our entrees arrived. My filet was cooked well and tender. However, I did not care for the peppers and creamy sauce it was topped with. Also, this was the only part of the meal that I had left overs to take home. For me, the portion sizes were about average. I did not have mounds of left overs as other reviews noted. We opted to skip dessert. Overall, it was a good meal but nothing blew me away. I had high hopes for AF and was slightly let down. For the price, I have had better meals and better service at other restaurants around the city.",0,qUeBDN0D8SC93KeAHhiL-g,0,4,2013-10-15,review,3

To kick things off- amazing oils, a cheese marmalade and HOT bread. 

The Meatball was excellent. Note I said Meatball, as this is one ball bigger than your fist. Stuffed with cheese, served in an amazing tomato sauce and topped with fresh parmesan. And this was just the appetizer

Next up was the Veal scallopini Tarfuto, which is served with onions. But before that arrived, first comes an amazing walnut vinagrette salad then a fresh pasta in vodka sauce. Both to die for. Picture the pain I am in before I even get to the veal. 

Then comes comes the veal. Succulent and melts in your mouth. No knife needed.

It goes without say I did finish a single plate, but what I did not finish served me well as breakfast the next morning! Round 2!

2) The bread and fixins (especially the bean and cheese gustoso), while EXTREMELY yummy, pale in comparison to the rest of the meal.  You want to wait for your meal.  Trust me.  YOU want to wait for the homemade pasta.
The smaller portions of veal are PLENTY and so unbelievably tender.  Also the preparation is really well balanced.  I had the Escalopes of veal (lots of mushrooms and spinach) and it felt like the veggies were integral to the dish.  Most places would have skimped . . . not Alla Famiglia.

Really good.  So good that I ate till I looked like I had a food baby in my stomach.  Pretty?  No.  Completely worth it?  Yes.",0,qUeBDN0D8SC93KeAHhiL-g,1,4,2013-11-21,review,1

If your looking for a memorable spot with some of the most delicious actually Italian dishes then look no further than Alla Famiglia. This is a restaurant to celebrate an occasion at such as New Years, Valentines Day, Anniversaries,etc. 
my girlfriend and I came here for New Year's Eve and we could not have enjoyed it more. To start we had the Alla Famiglia Meatball. I couldn't get over the rich tomato sauce that the meatball was surrounded in and the smoothness of the actual meat. Just delicious, must have.
When you order an entree you also get their house salad served in a homemade Italian vinaigrette (light and complimenting to the diverse salad topped with great peppers!) and their Penne Alla Vodka. This pasta dish alone is enough to warrant a visit . I am a alla vodka lover and this is the best I've ever had. It's hard to describe but its not to rich or creamy it's absolutely just right. The pasta itself was so smooth and melted in your mouth with their sauce.

For entree my girlfriend had their Ahi Tuna Steak (special). Prepared perfectly and with a great lemon butter sauce. I had their speciality, their double cut Veal Chop. This is something straight out of The Flintstones in its portion but let me tell you it's with every penny. I had the Veal Chop Pizzoaloa style wivh was with hot & sweet peppers, a great tomato sauce covered in provolone cheese. This was such a moist Veal Chop that literally fell off the bone and with the marbling it just melted in your mouth. 
Everything was spectacular , it's a restaurant you have to visit if your in the area at least once given you are willing to spend for your meal. $$$$ but you absolutely get what you pay for.",0,qUeBDN0D8SC93KeAHhiL-g,0,5,2013-12-31,review,2

We don't go out & splurge like this often, so we were really excited for a special dinner. The food was out of this world (bread & sides, salad, pasta alla vodka and veal chop Milanese), but the service was absolute garbage. I've seriously been treated better at a TGIFriday's. We waited, pretty much unattended to, at the bar until 8:20 for an 8:00 reservation. Once seated, I practically had to beg for a wine list. We called a cab at the end of our meal and decided to get drinks & wait back at the bar. The cab was taking forever, so we called a different company. As my boyfriend was talking with the cab company, a waitress walked by. We heard her walk into the kitchen and loudly announce to the rest of the staff, ""UGH, those people at the bar are JUST now ordering a cab."" It was 10:30. On a Saturday night.

I don't know if it was the fact that we were some of the youngest patrons in there (early/mid 20s), but we felt talked down to and disrespected the entire time. Maybe if we were in our 50s like everyone else, they would've treated us like adults.

When I plunk down $160 for one of the most highly-recommended restaurants around, I expect to be treated like I'm spending $160 at your restaurant. Despite how great the food was, I won't be returning. SO disappointed.",0,qUeBDN0D8SC93KeAHhiL-g,2,2,2014-03-02,review,6

I had the Veal Milanese and would have a hard time ordering something else next time. This was by far the best veal dish I have ever had and at $65 I would almost call this a steal. The vodka sauce pasta starter that comes with it is wonderful in and of itself, and the salad, the salad is spectacular! That's the thing about this place, not a single aspect of the meal disappoints or falls short of amazing. I did not order an appetizer as I had to send some of the pasta back as well as some of the veal because I just couldn't eat it all - this will feel like a sin, but what can you do. I am sure the appetizers are amazing as well. Lets not forget the martini that I would say is about the best you're going to find in ""the Burgh""! Not to mention it's BYOB, I brought my favorite bottle of California red wine to take the guess work out of the wine selection and guarantee an amazing amazing meal.

I have never eaten there before last night, but I have eaten at Davio's and that is what the atmosphere reminded me of.. we were there a total of 3 hours start to finish.. 3 hours until our main course was served. But, many courses are served as you wait... most of them were delicious. They bring you out fresh, delicious, warmed bread at the beginning with a garlic oil sauce dubbed ""holy oil"" and it truly is heavenly. They also have a bowl of cheese and garbanzo beans to eat atop of the bread. Delicious. There is also a cheesy spread available. All were wonderful. Then about 45 minutes later, they brought our appetizer. It was a soupy-looking mushroom appetizer with a sweet flavor. I do not recommend this app. It wasn't good. Then about 35 minutes after that, a salad was served. It came dressed and was one of the best I've had. 35-45 minutes after that, the HIGHLIGHT of the dinner came. Pasta in a bowl. It was the best part of the dinner. Finally another long time after that - our main course came. Mine looked only slightly better than it tasted. I got the seafood diavolo and it was a huge disappointment.
 I really liked our waiter - he was very busy but attentive - but I cursed him under my breath for recommending this main course. I was so close to ordering a pasta dish, which I'm certain I would have loved and devoured. But I was talked out of ordering pasta, because pasta comes with dinner. I wish our waiter would have asked me what I liked; sauces, etc before recommending this dish. $68 for something you give to your cat is a hard pill to swallow. I love seafood, but I enjoy it in butter sauces, lemony butter sauces, Alfredo sauces, wince sauces with garlic... not this red soupy dish.
 It was literally like eating cold tomatoes and water with Tabasco sauce poured in. It looked like ""seafood soup."" All the delicious seafood was drowning in a dark red, spicy, soupy mess. I wanted to cry when I saw it.. then I tasted it and really wanted to cry. It was gross. This is the last dish I would have ever ordered had I known how it was presented. I looked around at my date who had a massive veal tenderloin in front of him and I was so jealous.. wishing I had went with my first instinct - the pasta - or even the Halibut.. anything that wasn't drowning in a spicy red soup. I just hope that staff read this and never recommend this dish to a first-timer.. especially someone who enjoys seafood they can actually TASTE that isn't drowning in some spicy tomato sauce. If this dish wasnt so awful, I would have given 5 stars. The only other bad dish was the mushroom appetizer, and it was also a soupy mess. but, i would eat the mushroom app 3 times a day for the rest of my life if it came down to that and the seafood diavolo.",0,qUeBDN0D8SC93KeAHhiL-g,0,3,2014-08-15,review,1

My husband took me here for my birthday celebration.  We were treated extremely well from the second we walked in the door.  They even had a menu printed with a ""Happy birthday Jennifer"" message on the top!  What a nice touch.

We were seated in the area near the door with a view of the kitchen.  There is also a small room (three tables) on the same floor.  The upper floor has a dining area and bar, but they are often booked for private events.

When you arrive, there are three accompaniments for your fresh baked bread.  The ""holy oil"" that is an olive oil and banana pepper mix.  It lives up to its name because it was divine.  There was also a goat cheese spread that had red peppers and olives.  I'm a huge goat cheese fan, so I could have eaten this by the spoonful.  There was also a bean and cheese mixture with three types of cheese chopped up.  It was incredible as well.  You may be tempted to fill up on these delictible delights, but don't, becase as good as these items are, it only gets better from there.

We were having a hard time deciding whether to get the meatball appetizer or the hand pulled mozzarella.  The waitress steered us towards their meatball since it is one of their signature items.  It was a wise decision.  The meatball is the size of a fist and it was perfect.  I don't usually like meatballs or red sauce and I found myself devouring every last bit of both on this plate.  The meatball is stuffed and topped with an excellent mozzarella and then drenched with an amazing red sauce with bits of garlic.  If you order this, make sure you are sharing because it is huge. 

The salad course was very tasty.  It as a mix of field greens, an olive oil dressing, gorgonzola and other incredibly tasty things.  I could have eaten the entire plate of it myself but wanted to save room for the pasta and my entree.

The pasta course is a house made spiral pasta in a vodka sauce.  It was extremely tasty.  So much so that my husband said he would have been happy if that alone had been his main course.  It had such incredible fresh taste.  

For our main courses, I got the veal chop prepared in the milanese style.  It was HUGE, pretty much the size of the plate.  A nice surprise considering how small portions tend to be at other fancy restaurants in the area.  It was served with a lemon butter sauce and had large chunks of crab on top.  It was tender and you could cut it with a fork.  I savored every bite (and have leftovers to enjoy at home).  My husband had the filet and loved his choice as well.  A lot of flavors and extremely tender.  It was served with a leek cream and I would love to know how they make it because I have leeks at home that I need to use for something.

I swore I didn't have room left for even a single bite more, but when I learned that pumpkin gelato was the dessert, I had to try it.  It was so smooth, sweet and reminded me of the amazing gelato I had when I was in Italy.  A house made limoncello completed my incredibly amazing meal.

Yes, it is expensive, but it is worth it!  I don't know when we'll be back simply because of how expensive it is, but I do know we'll be back.",4,qUeBDN0D8SC93KeAHhiL-g,0,5,2014-10-30,review,6

Both desserts are served w cream and taste fantastic! The pie has a very banana-ish texture with pieces of coconuts in it.

The atmosphere is warm and cozy and not stuffy at all, which is not often the case with ""fine dining.""  I appreciated the home-like feeling and the framed Pens jerseys on the wall! I am becoming a Yinzer...

The bread and holy oil, chickpea dish, and goat cheese spread that they set the table with was amazingly good, and it only gets better.  All their meals come with a salad and a pasta dish with vodka sauce.  (I didn't see anything about fettucine in a cheese wheel, so maybe they don't do that anymore--not sure.)

I ordered seafood diavolo but could only finish about 1/3 of it, and my husband ordered a steak dish that he (amazingly) polished off.  He said it was the best steak he's had since we left Nebraska, so that's a pretty high compliment.

Yes, this place is expensive ($50-ish/entree), but you can DEFINITELY get at least two meals from one, and there is an option to share a dinner with a $15 charge for the extra pasta and salad dish, which may be the route I would take in the future since I'm a snacker and would rather have an appetizer as dinner anyway.

fosbOwcjCpQHuNIBBlIKFw,pxmtC4Mir2eQz4iL1fTGMg,"This was my second time to Ala Famiglia.  It's been a few years, and we figured, the Saturday after Thanksgiving would be perfect for italian - a welcome break from turkey.

Unexpected, and awful problem with our experience.

Our party of nine was seated onetime for our 5 pm reservation.  Drink orders were taken, bread and assorted accoutrements of oil and such were brought to the table.  Waitress was pleasant, holiday tunes playing (over 6 separate speakers in the small upstairs bar/table area - quality sound, something I appreciate) and muted Penn State football game on the flat screen.  We were settled in for a good meal.  

Appetizers arrived approximately an hour later.  They were quite good.  The 12 ounce meatball was fantastic.  It was covered in a great tomato sauce, and hit the spot.   We ordered the calamari, and even a second round of the prosciutto wrapped prawns.  Pasta arrived - it was good, but it should be at Ala Famiglia.  

The dinners arrived at 7:25.   Yes, it was a 5:00 reservation.  At least it gave our Brunello time to breath.   The portions were big.  Lots of veal dishes, rib eyes, and filets.   Non cooked too long, or too short.  

So why the mediocre review?  The long wait?  No.   We were in good company, and enjoyed being together.  The problem was the large number of fruit flies that were all over our table.  I first noticed them in one of the empty cocktail glasses.  They liked the remnants of the Manhattan - and the cherry left in the glass.   Three of them dead, two more flew away when I waived my hand.  

That caused me to look over at my wine glass holding the $140 per bottle Brunello......yep, one dead, and one alive.  What do you do?  I fished out the dead one, and covered my glass with a cocktail napkin.  This was pretty disgusting.  We mentioned it to the waitress, but she didn't respond or summon a manager.  Not looking for a free meal or anything, but as a business owner myself, I would think they would want to know about the problem, and get it rectified asap.  

I like the food, but I won't likely be back.  Oh, and for the 9 people, the meal was just shy of a $1,000.",0,qUeBDN0D8SC93KeAHhiL-g,0,3,2014-11-30,review,1
hru2IDwSyN61sgWPtJw_hA,utF_7QHQD-WKeXnAW-9wJA,"I had been wanting to come here for a very long time.  I finally ate here this past Saturday and it was awesome.  Now I can't wait to come back!

First, I urge you to make a reservation because every single table was filled while we were there, and for good reason--the food is AWESOME.  The food is so good you aren't even going to feel guilty about the calories you have consumed--because you will eat A LOT OF THEM.

The second thing you need to know is to show up HUNGRY.  Don't eat all day.  If possible, do what I did and work out earlier in the day, because you will leave this restaurant WELL FED.  To quote one of the great artists of our time, Ice Cube, ""Life ain't a track meet, its a marathon!""

It is a marathon.  They're going to bring you out delicious warm bread as soon as you sit down, and supply you with heavenly toppings for it, including the famous Holy Oil that is truly divine.  Temperance is a virtue.  Don't be like me and commit a sin against your entree by eating it when you are STUFFED, and can't fully enjoy it. because like a fool you couldn't restrain yourself with the bread bc carbs turn you into AN ANIMAL and you didn't pace yourself.

You'll get all the bread you can handle.  Our waiter John, who was super nice and attentive, suggested we order the meatball appetizer and he was right.  Its huge, its literally the size of a softball and comes out wrapped in cheese, in a heavenly marinara sauce, served with love.  It was extremely good.  

Then you get the salad course, which comes in a home made vinagrette which is also delicious.  

Then comes the pasta course,  We had fusilli pasta in vodka sauce which was very good but at this point I was basically full and tapping out.  I ended up eating not even 1/4 of my pasta, but then the waiter offered to bag it up for me, so I had lunch for the next day.

Your entree comes out after the pasta course, and you're going to be already stuffed at this point.

 Now, I took my friend here for his birthday.  I think they key is to come here when you are not paying, bc my bank account was crying when I saw the entrees start at $40.  More on that in a moment.

I ordered the filet and it was SPECTACULAR.  I mean, amazing.  So good I did not share, and after I ate it, I fondly reflected on the time my filet and I spent together.  Temporarily in my mouth, forever in my heart.  Or on my hips.  It was not diet food, it was covered in some sort of heavenly cream cheese sauce that is the stuff dreams are made of.  It was a $60 dinner and it tasted like one too.  

My friend ordered the blackened sea bass and it came out looking like a work of art.  Both our dishes were basically food porn.  He loved his dinner too and said that his fish came out topped with large chunks of crab and he loved it.

We were waayyy too full to even think about dessert.  I'm sure the desserts would have been divine but we just could not do it.  In fact I ended up taking half my filet home with me.

This place is technically expensive, but if you think about it, it's really not that bad.  Our bill came to $200 for the two of us, but for what you get, it's really a pretty damn good deal.  You get top notch service, the restaurant itself is beautiful, and the food is absolutely incredible.  This was probably the best meal I have had in Pittsburgh.  Oh--and you get enough food that you get a full meal the next day.

3JCJYpQpNDC6lmA7JFFIbw,qJwRAuwkH17flL4omfaRQg,"Let me start out by saying that we rarely look to dining out for Italian food. We have found that to find quality Italian worthy of spending $$ outside of our own home has been difficult to find in the Burg. Don't get me wrong, there are plenty of Italian restaurants out there, but none we would seek out for a special occasion, so to speak. We have always found the New York/New Jersey establishments more to our liking....until now.

Alla Famiglia is nestled in a not so nice of a neighborhood in the Burg called Allentown. Although we were never worried, but I could see how some may feel it is out of place in it's location. There is valet parking, so need to worry about your car while dining. Now once you are inside, you will soon forget where you are.

The inside is very small and there are 3 floors where you may be seated for your meal. On this occassion, we were seated on the third floor. Way up, climbing 3 flights of stairs can work up an appetite. Once on the 3rd level however, you can enjoy some of the religious artwork and beautiful stainglass featured throughout the dining area. There were 5 tables of various sizes and the bonus was the private restroom located nearby, so you did not have to manage the steps again until you were finished with your meal. 

I would also like to mention that we were dining early and although the room was rather private at first, it became QUITE loud as the evening went on and other patrons were being seated. I also think the free flowing wine helped the noise levels as the night progressed. Needless to say, we had difficulty hearing one another towards the end of the meal.

There were 5 in our party and our server was very attentive throughout the night to make sure any requests or special customizations were welcomed and met. We started our meal with the complimentary bread, dipping oils, goat cheese spread and cheese medley brought to the table. We all agreed to share the famous 12 oz stuffed meatball which was enjoyed by everyone at the table. In fact, everyone was asking for more of the wonderful sauce to accompany thier bread.

Several items are served family style and come with any of the entrees that are ordered. We were then delivered and very tasty salad tossed with a light vinegarette which included olives, nuts and cranberries. Gorgonzola was brought on the side if desired. Then the pasta with vodka sauce made it's arrival. Several mentioned that they would have just ordered this if they knew how delicious it was. And this was just the beginning....

On came the entrees, several veal dishes were ordered, as it is their signature item on the menu. Although there were also many specials offered that night, everyone seemed to gear towards the classics. I ordered the veal marsala, which was delish! It was certainly one of the best I have had. One member of our dining party ordered the special pork chop offered that was huge! Another entree ordered was the filet mignon topped with lump crab meat and gorgonzola cream sauce. It literally melted in your mouth! I decided this would definitely be ordered on my next visit. All the food was cooked perfectly to order and scrumptious!

We were all pretty full but decided to share the Burnt almond tiramisu stuffed with raspberry for dessert. It was divine! I swear I heard the angels in the nearby painting sing as we devoured it!

As others had mentioned, it is a bit pricey, but for special occassions it is a must do. I felt it was quite worth every penny of our bill which was $306 for the party of 5. (We did BYOB) We have dined at much more expensive establishments and left unimpressed, which was not the case at all here.

The only negative was the long walk down the steps through the many other diners after too much wine. It can be challenging! So, watch your step! But do make a visit, you won't be disappointed!",1,qUeBDN0D8SC93KeAHhiL-g,0,5,2015-01-11,review,1

Restaurant is small with very busy/tight space vibe.  Try antipasto appetizer if available when you go.  Also, the meatball appetizer is kind of a signature item to this establishment, so absolutely try as well.  All entrees comes with salad and pasta, so come ready for a big meal that will be worth every calorie, every bite.   We had veal and duck entrees and they really were quite deliciously special.  Lots of leftovers came home with us.

9ThWKhrw8ghY_ZOtvGTmYg,LigAllZ19c1CenJlz5wxpA,"This spot is the definition of a hidden gem. I lived in Pittsburgh for 5 years and still had not been here or heard of it despite my extreme obsession with Italian food. It was thanks to Yelp we discovered it and what a discovery!!!!

Its been a couple months since I ate here so my memory of each course is a little foggy but, suffice it to say, that every single time I now crave Italian food, this restaurant is what comes to mind. I now live in Philly otherwise I would probably end up here every other week (which would hit hard on the wallet since its delicious but pricey).

It's a small place with a very romantic/intimate vibe and an authentic feel. The portions were generous and extremely tasted even better re-heated the next day (a rare thing). 

The one thing I would advise is do not gorge on the bread! This will be very difficult to do as it is delicious, along with the oil it is served with but you will regret it because there will be a lot of food coming afterwards. The waiter warned us but we couldn't resist and barely had room for the delicious courses that followed.

This might be one of my all time favorite restaurants and I plan to come here again (most likely for an occasion that warrants the cost).",1,qUeBDN0D8SC93KeAHhiL-g,0,5,2015-01-19,review,2

They start you off with freshly baked bread accompanied with olive oil with basil and pepper, a chickpea, pepper flakes and cheese mix, and a goat cheese and walnut spread. The next course is a salad with red wine vinaigrette with olives, roasted red peppers and raisins. They bring out a pasta with vodka sauce about 5 minutes before the entrees, sort of like a side to the meal. My boyfriend got the Veal Chop Milanese which was excellent, soft with a crispy crust. I got the Seafood Diavolo, it was pure seafood heaven for me. It had a nice spicy kick to it, without being overbearing. The wait staff was very attentive and friendly.

1) Honest. It is honest in its presentation and commitment to the abbreviated menu that it produces. 

2) Outstanding. The Chef and his team execute at a very very high level. 

Protip: I came in on a very slow moment. Early early dinner with some work people. We had the pleasure of talking to the Chef- as we were seated at the table just by the door, in close proximity to the kitchen (you'll get it when you get there). We liked the guy so much we handed the menus back to the server and told him to just bring us whatever the chef suggested. 

The whole meal was amazing. But I will say this without any qualification. The next sentence is not at all taken lightly. 

The smoked cheese app with truffle oil, arugula, and lemon was the best first bite of food I have ever had in my life, a life that has had a considerable amount of top contenders for bites.

ZvHFyiGkq45JUGOgh-rjUQ,9-9hwJ7ZlFTmKq0kqyqbmA,"Rating the overall experience we had here.

First off this is family style multi-course meal;  every main dish comes with a salad and pasta dish to share.  The salad is one of the best salads I remember eating and could easily be enough for an appetizer.  The pasta tossed in a vodka sauce was just ok.  The homemade pasta is not actually made in house (I asked), but it is 'fresh,' which I'm assuming meant bought from a store on the strip or a market district.

We had also ordered the calamari and the meatball appetizer because we were starving and that proved to be way too much food for a family of 5.  If you must get an appetizer, I highly recommend the meatball, you will not regret.

The veal chop is easily the best thing on the menu and where Alla Famiglia really shines.  From all the pasta plates and steaks and seafood dishes that were ordered at our table, the veal chop was by the unanimous favorite at our table.  Incredible flavors and tender cuts, but by the time you get to the main course, you're full with the bread, salad, and pasta that comes before you can't really enjoy it fully.  Most plates come with a side of their grilled veggies (which again were ok), but some dishes come with nothing so I would make sure to ask if you need a side.   So long story short, this is a marathon and don't expect to be done in an hour and a half.  Pace so you can really enjoy that veal chop at the end!

When you first walk in it seems very small, but there are back rooms and stairs that go up one or two floors.  There's also a back patio one floor up from ground floor.  It's tight sitting spaces, but very cute and authentically Italian.  

So now that we established that the ambiance and food are pretty solid, the thing that earned this 3 stars is how we were hosted to our table.  We had a reservation at 7:30pm and were 30minutes early, which we recognize is nowhere near to our reservation time so we elected to grab drinks and sit on the patio.  When 7:30 comes around we inquire about our table only to be told that there was not a sitting space yet, which would be ok minus the fact that there were multiple tables open that we asked about.  7:45 we asked again and were told that they were setting up a table immediately.  8:10 comes around and we're still not seated so had to ask the hostess again, which apologized and sat us at the table we had asked about 40 minutes ago when our reservation time was.  It took 40 minutes to seat us at our table for our reservation time of 7:30 when there were tables open.

It was a frustrating experience because everyone was hungry and we weren't even offered bread sitting on their patio...  The frustration unfortunately set the mood for the dinner and although our food was great, we didn't really enjoy the time we had here. 

We really wanted to love Alla Famiglia.  Perhaps we'll try one more time and hope our experience is better.",0,qUeBDN0D8SC93KeAHhiL-g,0,3,2015-06-20,review,4

2BYGvFAgV87LgIk4EqLtwg,UyXBv9KR4BN-OGIzY7RcKg,"One of the best meals that I have had in PIttsburgh.  We had the mussels in a slightly spicy red sauce, and their meatball.  For both of these appetizers, the sauce was amazing - the best that I have had.  So good that I could have happily made a meal out of the sauce and their bread, which was hot and fresh.  For our entres, we had the lamb chops and the veal chops, cooked Milanese style.  Both dishes were cooked perfectly - the Milanese was pan fried and a bit delicately flavored, but wonderful.  The service was very good, and all the staff were working very hard and quick, but were available to answer questions and assist us when needed.  I would recommend making reservations well in advance and trying to get one of the tables upstairs - a more quiet and intimate setting, also slightly more comfortable temperature wise for me.  The kitchen is downstairs, and is open to the dining room, so I think we got some of the heat. I will definitely go back there someday.",0,qUeBDN0D8SC93KeAHhiL-g,0,5,2015-07-09,review,0

_1K-P9c-B7sOdjVp61XuZQ,hEuwyC4CvIF2LJORaR3q_w,"I do not say this with many 2 star ratings but I would like to go back for another try.  The reason is simple, in reading the reviews below, I have to assume we hit Alla Famigilia on a bad night, at least I hope so.  The main reason for the low rating was the service.  We were seated on the third floor which is their bar area, at a high top table and the bar tender was our server.  She had to mix drinks for every table on the third floor, tend to the patrons at the bar and come around to wait on our table.  That was not fair to her and definitely not fair to us.  Her service and attentiveness lacked for obvious reasons but even when she was ""free"" she walked by our table without a glance and was apparently hard of hearing.  Furthermore, when ever one person got her attention for another drink or something, she said okay and left, without giving anyone else a chance to order.  The rest of the staff tried to pick up the slack a little but they were jammed as well.  Sounds weird, but I never felt so rushed in a 3 hour dinner.  The food took awhile, which is fine and expected on a busy Saturday night, just keep the drinks flowing and stop by once in a awhile so we don't notice.

I also did not like that we were seated at a high top table.  I love the high tops for drinks and a few apps but for a 3 hour meal, these were uncomfortable, especially if your legs didn't hit the chair cross bars correctly (either too short or too tall).

The food was good, very good in some instances and disappointing in one.  I loved the pasta with Vodka sauce and the salad, both part of the entree which is unusual for a high end restaurant.  The meatball appetizer and the calamari and shrimp appetizer were the best things I ate all evening.  The biggest disappointment was the veal chop.  I love a good bone in veal chop but was leaning towards a seafood dish. I ended up changing my mind right before I ordered as I saw the veal chop brought out to another table and it looked amazing.  The disappointment was it was over-cooked.  It came out medium well at best (closer to well) and for $68, and for the amount they were serving that night, they should know how to cook them to perfection.  Not a spot of pink to be found.  No one even asked us during our meal if everything was okay or any issues.  When most of the chop remained on my plate and everyone else's entree was 90% eaten, not even a ""was everything okay"".  Just clear me out and get on with the next one.

I hope to have the opportunity to go back and I will not be seated in the third floor bar area and I will not get my same waitress and give it another try.  I expected so much more.",0,qUeBDN0D8SC93KeAHhiL-g,0,2,2015-09-28,review,2

I love a good coursed meal, absolutely love it. We started with the hand rolled mozzarella, which was fantastic. As was the white bean spread. The salad was fresh and crisp. My absolute favorite part of the meal though was the pasta with vodka sauce. I could write songs about this pasta dish. I'm telling you now the next time we return I will simply eat this pasta until I'm so full I could die a fat and happy death. 
For our entrees Chris had the veal chop (holy mother this thing had to weigh 5 pounds! And it was PERFECTLY cooked). And I very much enjoyed the mahi. We did not even remotely save room for dessert.

We went on a weekday evening and ordered the meatball as an appetizer after a suggestion by our waitress Courtney, (who was ridiculously nice, helpful, and amazing at her job).  She did not steer us wrong.  Get the meatball, it's life changing.

I ordered the Filet Mignon which came with a pasta side in alla vodka sauce.  I have been searching in vain in Pittsburgh to find a place that knows how to make vodka sauce; I've found it.  Everything was delicious and made exactly as requested.

My only regret is that I did not know this place existed previously.  Worth every penny and then some.  I can't wait to go back.",0,qUeBDN0D8SC93KeAHhiL-g,0,5,2016-01-15,review,1

There was a gas leak and they were being forced to close early. Thier solution was to cook everything and bring it out to the table at one time.  Ugh!!!! A 5 course meal in an hour and 15 minutes.  If I'm spending $150 for a meal for 2 I'd like it to not have all the courses at once.

Next, (and this is unbelievable) we were on the second floor and at the bar 5 feet away was A PAIR OF HOOKERS. LOL!!!! How do I know they were prostitutes? Well between drunkenly and loudly dropping the ""F"" bomb they would drunkenly and loudly discuss business. When we asked if they should be shut off we were told there was little that could be done BECAUSE THEY WERE REGULARS. I swear I'm not making this up... I should post in tips ""When making reservations ask to be seated in a room different from the prostitutes.""

NzwP2NJ0lmRqTXWeYp8s5w,JDe_JNxz7xOBSUVRKI24rA,"My grandmother, a woman from Italy who expresses little emotion, commented ""they have good food there"" after we left--the ultimate sign of approval. 
I called the restaurant on the day of, and while they clearly were pretty booked, the hostess graciously fit our party in (for a party of 5 they plan to allocate 2.5 hrs). There was unexpected traffic on our way in, so called to give a heads up, and whoever picked up was very forgiving and even tried to help us find a better route.  Though we arrived a few minutes late for the reservation, this was not made to be a big deal and we were seated immediately. 

The atmosphere is as if you are having dinner in your Italian grandmothers house (I know this because I have an Italian grandmother), very warm and cozy and decorations that can stimulate a conversation.  They have a nice selection of cocktails, and of course wine, but it is definitely a place you go for the food. 

Our waiter told us they currently get their bread from mancinis, but made it sound as though they will be going back to making their own rather soon.  The bread is offered with multiple options for spreading/dipping including an olive oil based dip and a goat cheese spread, which was my favorite.  For appetizers, we tried the meatball--which comes out as one giant meatball but was more than enough as an appetizer for 5--and the fried cheese. Both were delicious, and my brother even took the extra red sauce home. 

The main courses did not disappoint either.  With each entree you get a ""side"" salad--which was good enough to be a meal itself--and some of their clearly homemade pasta.  I'm not sure if they always serve the sides the same way, but he pasta came in a vodka sauce that was just the right amounts of creamy and spicy, and they offer an oil you can add individually if you are one that likes extra spice.  I had the cotoletta del monzu (forgive my spelling) or breaded veal cutlets AND crabmeat, so juicy and flavorful.  My brother (who I didn't think ate seafood) had a seafood diavlo dish and loved it.  The only complaint was that the ""spicy oil"" was still not spicy enough, but I doubt this would be of concern to anyone besides my mother.   

In summary, I am a person who generally doesn't like to go to Italian restaurants--I don't really like pasta and I've had so much Italian food in my life--but if you live in or are even just visiting Pittsburgh, alla famiglia is a must!",0,qUeBDN0D8SC93KeAHhiL-g,1,5,2016-05-24,review,2

Overall, this place has quick service and throws in lots of big chunks of fresh vegetables. When's the last time you had vegetable fried rice with chunks of bell pepper, broccoli, pea pods, and onion. The Kung Pao chicken could be spicier but next time I'll ask.

Also, there are free extras when you order $20 or more (such as a 2 liter of Pepsi).

Update:  Much to my great sadness and disappointment, I have had to stop patronizing this establishment due to the extremely rude and unprofessional man they hired to answer the phone.  We tolerated it the first few times, even got a laugh out of the fact that he actually dropped the F bomb a few times while taking our order.   But when he became hostile and irate with me on a recent order, it was all over.  He started like he always does by laughing at our street name and having me spell it 5 times, then interrupted the order without excusing himself to set down the phone and yell at some children I heard in the background, then he argued with me about what the menu in my hand said, telling me I was wrong and it said something different.

To sitting in a spa chair with ripped upholstery I felt neither pampered nor impressed. I MIGHT have looked beyond such things because of the affordable price till I got home and realized that my nails hadn't been cut short as I had very clearly asked nor had she taking care of an ingrown toenail.

The first one we called, Fagnelli Heating & Cooling, came out and diagnosed the problem- our unit was about 2-3 pounds low of freon.  It was an old unit and that freon would have cost around $120 per pound so we were looking at $360 just to charge it back up.  They also identified the leaks & rust spots that would probably allowed it to continue leaking...  Time for a new unit.  Fagnelli quoted us $3700 for the complete job which included a 10yr warranty.  That a/c check itself cost us close to $400 because they did a dye test to find the leaks.   

Then we called Staab for an estimate.  They came when they were supposed to, did a similar inspection and quoted a similar (3 ton) unit for $2700 plus $300 for a 10 yr warranty.  Of course they got the job.

They showed up at 8:45am, 15 minutes early, were very professional (even put down sheets over our carpet to catch any dust & debris from the inside unit as they carried it through the house), kept my wife informed of their process but didn't try to train her on how to install them (you know how some tradesmen do- they want you to understand WAY too much than you really want to know), and they finished up the job by noon.  They cleaned up the entire workspace so I had no idea they were even down there aside from gleaming new equipment.

I thought maybe a days worth of work and a couple hundred dollars worth of fitting.   The problem is that I have no toilet or running water until this gets fixed and they could see that.   The quote was $2600 dollars.  I asked them to explain the high cost and they estimated 2 people for 2 days and said the fitting were really expensive.

I tried to peruse the menu before ordering but I couldn't find it online anywhere which is disappointing because the hard copy they have available had at least 300 different options from apps, combos, sides, and entrees. 

I got their General Tso's Chicken (extra spicy) and because my order was a take-out over $12, they threw in two free egg rolls. #win 

(Other offers are Free 1 Small Fried Rice w/purchase of $16, Free General Tso's or Sesame Chicken w/purchase over $28)  

I called on my way there and it took about 10-15 .... When I walked in, everything was ready to go. Large portion of chicken was served in plastic and rice was in standard paper folder container. They were not stingy about duck sauce, soy sauce, and fortune cookies. #win #win

Just like the reviews below, the General Tso's was just so-so. It definitely wasn't extra spicy but it did have a mild kick to it. To me, the sauce tasted a bit like wing sauce from a dive bar. I would get it again because it was good but it didn't have an oriental flavor to it. When ordering from a strip mall Chinese food place, I always expect each piece of General Tso's to be a quarter chicken and the rest fatty breading to which I dissect and just eat the meat.  My expectations were met but I wasn't disappointed because the chicken was good. 
The meal had a decent amount of broccoli in it which was cooked perfectly for my taste, a little firmer. 

The egg rolls were OK. Super crispy and not much filling...plenty of oil. They were free and so I can't really complain.  

I will definitely eat here again. I'll probably try Sha Cha chicken because it's spicier or Kung Po. This place is good if you want cheap food that will hit a Chinese take-out craving. 

Everyone that worked there was really nice - Even the chef in the back said hello. That alone goes a long way in my opinion. 

Side note - It's the day after and I'm not sick so I give my seal of health approval.",0,LltDzuzRbAJbSrqD4JH-3A,0,3,2013-10-23,review,2

The food is excellent American Chinese cuisine. The broccoli is always cooked perfectly, it is nice and bright green and firm yet not tough to chew. The chicken breast is always light and lean. Love the garlic white sauce used on the moo goo gai pan. Vi loves the plum sauce. There are several Chinese restaurants in Carrick and Mt. Oliver and I'd rate this one the best.

I went in with the intention of buying a jacket, helmet and gloves. Their store is pretty nice inside, and they have a good selection of gear (mostly dirt-oriented though). 

I wasn't quite sure what I wanted, so I asked a lady for some assistance in picking out a helmet. She was helpful, and recommended a jacket that would be usable in different types of weather. However, a friend who was with me said he had a different type of jacket (which they also sold), and she commented that the ""hated"" that jacket and that the liner was ""nothing more than a glorified garbage bag."" Ok...

We also talked to a guy at the register about a '96 KTM 300 MXC that my friend just bought, and asked a simple question about a clutch cable. The guy seemed totally disinterested and clueless, and I'm not really sure if he even knew what a clutch was. He ended the conversation by saying that my friend should just throw his bike away because it was so old. What!?

Even after that, I still bought a jacket from them and ordered a helmet I liked that they had assured me would be in later that week. I then got a call from them a few days later saying that the helmet was no longer available, but that I could pick another style. I then just ordered the helmet online and went back the next day to get a refund.

I wanted to like this place, but between the thinly-veiled insults and seemingly clueless repair staff, I don't think I'll ever return.

7IPdr4DfB5TizGvUGZeozA,LijOO2QAftcPpRVi1rv08Q,"DiCarlos is in my opinion THE BEST pizza in the Pittsburgh area. My boyfriend and I will only order DiCarlos if we are in a pizza mood. It's different from your traditional pizza that they only cook the crust with the sauce, all the other toppings are added after it comes out of the oven. The cheese is all melty on the top and it's yum yum delicious! You have to try it. The only other pizza joint that I can think of that is anything similar is Beto's over on Banksville Road in Dormont (or Greentree, where's the line?)

This is take out only. No eating there guys. Also, there's not really a ""small"" option and all of their pizza's are square. If that's a problem, find another pizza joint!

This is not even worthy of the name.  I got 3 extra cheese.  First off, the pizza was basically glued to the wax paper.  The crust was unevenly cooked.  First bite the crust was almost raw, dense, and way too chewy.  The sauce tasted sour and the cheese (shredded, not dices provolone like the Original) was slimy.  My second bite, the crust was burned, tasted burned, but at least it was crunchy.  There was no third bite.  The remaining slices got tossed in the garbage.

Wg8G0l8A7VMdEmP6PcNsIA,u5SNrXFH4HzWv2lEGcuXVQ,"One of the happiest moments of my life began with me picking up the phone and calling the number for DiCarlo's. Someone answered and I had a brief, awkward conversation that basically went something like

 'Are... are you guys really open?'
'Yep.'
'And this is DICARLO'S PIZZA, right?'
'Yep.'
'Am I dreaming?!'
*click*

You see, they opened one of these portals to heaven in Cranberry a few years ago. It was love at first bite. I went there frequently and tried to recruit as many allies as I could. The insanely crunchy crust, the zippy tomato sauce, the CHEESE! The first slice of the day with completely cold, unmelted cheese was always just as good as the last one which would have melted the cheese slightly and gotten the tiniest bit less crunchy. It doesn't matter because the ingredients themselves are just tasty. But tragedy struck and Cranberry failed hard again at supporting good pizza and the store closed. I did some research online and discovered that, yes, DiCarlo's did still exist, but only in faraway lands that I would likely never travel to for pizza or any other reason.

But one day, I noticed something exhilarating. Is that a DiCarlo's location IN PITTSBURGH?! HOW LONG HAS THIS BEEN HERE? I felt confused, excited, bashful, sleepy, doc, but most of all relieved. That is until I decided I would need to confirm their existence with a quick phone call. See above.

That very night, I traveled to the south hills (a rare treat...) to rekindle my love affair. I gotta say, friends, this was one of the best first bites I have ever had. Exactly as I remember it. Four slices of pepperoni pizza and an Orange Crush. This is living. And I gotta say, it feels great.

We ordered an 8-cut (medium) pizza with anchovies. The problem is quantitative. They appear to be using the original recipe however the amount of dough, cheese, and sauce is literally 40% or less of what it used to be. Anthony's always had a thin crusted pizza, but this is now paper thin! I've been making pizza for years and have been to all the best pizza restaurants in Pittsburgh as a lifelong resident so I know good pizza and what is expected in terms of sizing. One piece was so small it literally fit within the palm of my hand (fingers excluded!) - we were shocked. To compound the misery, when my sister called to explain, she was not rude - polite, yet honest and firm, the woman who is co-owner was condescending and sarcastic and asked how she thought the pizza could be made better! My sister then calmly explained how the amount of dough and cheese used was less than half of what it should have been for a medium sized pizza. 

The worst thing, and this really reflects on the woman's character and business ethics, is that not once did she offer an apology! Not even a simple ""I'm sorry."" That is outrageous and inexcusable. This was no small inconsequential complaint, it was a serious issue, yet it didn't even phase her. Also she didn't offer us a refund, she didn't offer to remake the pizza, nor did she offer us any sort of discount on future purchases. Needless to say we will never go there again. It's a shame because Anthony's used to have great pizza (I reviewed it when it was under the old ownership.) and we could have been loyal customers for years to come. Oh I should also note that the woman's 15/16 year old son, who looks like he has no experience cooking, is the cook! Even still she watched him make the pizza and she herself closed the box and handed it to me so she can't claim ignorance - on the phone she was incredulous. 

Also the ambiance of Anthony's is not the same. They removed the venerable booths and replaced them with tables, took down the folk art collage on the main wall and no longer offer IBC soda. If they keep up these ridiculously small portions I can't see them staying in business very long. This is Carrick, not Sewickley or Mt. Lebanon. People around here expect value for their money and will not tolerate what they are doing.

I have to say that because they have just reopened, all of the local people who loved this food have been coming back so the wait was quite long. I think it is worth it though. And since this is their first weekend being reopened, I am sure they will work out the kinks soon.

In terms of the restaurant itself, they walls have lost a little character. There used to be a collage of black and white photos of celebrities covering the walls. Now everything is covered in this stone wallpaper, some of which is upside down.

This place is SO unbelievably cool.  The taps are constantly changing up, the specials are awesome, and my biggest surprise was that the food was amazing.

The waitstaff and bartenders are knowledgeable, efficient and friendly.  And the owner of the bar who doubles as the chef is a charming mofo.

OH, and, you get to throw peanut shells on the damn floor.  I would never have guessed that I would gain such satisfactions from a never ending supply of peanuts and popcorn, but I do.  I really do.

*note: this place would be fucking deadly for anybody with a peanut allergy.*

The crowd is usually awesome and they have live music regularly.  It's in an emerging area of the North Side.  It's an area that really has come leaps and bounds from when I was growing up here, but it can still get pretty sketchy later in the evening.  I say this as a smoker who gets to go outside and watch the circus as it unfolds.

Places like this are why the North Side has always been such an awesome area and will eventually regain the crowds of it's glory days.  It's not like a mirrored-room with polka dot mannequins, but then again, what is?

Beer on tap are mixed between the regulars: Yuengling, Mad Hat, Guiness and lots of seasonal and rotating beers.  I love a place with a good draft offering.  I'm way more into a draft than a bottle.  Don't ask me why...maybe because the gulps can be bigger:)

  This bar is less than 5 minutes from where I live.  I stopped in on a Saturday night and was pleased with the music that was playing and also the fact that the bar was not overcrowded. The bar tender barely acknowledged me the whole night.  

There wasn't any free peanuts or popcorn when I visited. Nor did they have the beer that I like on tap.  I did get a very tasty double chocolate stout, which I found to be delicious in every way.  The owner of the place even gave me an annoyed look.

Saturday night is usually a crappy night to try out any new place.  The service was slow but I got the feeling that the bartender couldn't be bothered to wait on me.

They have a surprisingly excellent beer selection, mostly micros.  The drafts aren't cheap, at $5-$8 a draft but Happy Hour is from 6-8pm and is $2 off a draft. 

We also tried the food.  While nothing to write home about, it's not bad by any means.  Decent falafel, hummus, lamb gyro...very Middle Eastern-centric.  I'm pretty sure I also ate my weight in peanuts and popcorn.

Plus, I liked how they have Happy Hour later than most other places, from 6-8 pm ($2 off all drafts). 

Always looking to try something new and/or local, I ordered a pint of Helltown Mischievous Brown ale, brewed in Mount Pleasant, PA. Not bad. If you're hungry, you can either grab some complimentary popcorn or peanuts to snack on.

They have all you can eat Popcorn and Peanuts so you will never be in want of something to snack on while drinking your favorite beer. 

They have live bands several times a week my favorite being Tuesdays which often features local Blue Grass musicians.  

The down side to this place for me is that it's a little on the expensive side. They have a majority of their beers that are 6+ bucks a pint which a bit much. You can get some for $4.50 - $5  but it cuts your selection significantly. It definitely makes you think twice before going here often. I just wish all their beers were under $5 because I would probably try and go here more often.

YxiAEtBOUEqfTE_-eY7N3A,NHwTHZSbK2YB37Z7GAKlUg,"I can't say enough great things about this place.  I have never had a bad experience here and the owner and staff are fabulous.  The North Side has struggled for years to try to gentrify and it's been a slow process. If more places like The Park House would open in the neighborhood the effect could be exponential.

I've been a patron for just about a year on the dot.  I can honestly say that I drove by more than a few times and didn't stop (even though friends recommended it) because I didn't know what I would find.  Boy, I wish I had that time back!  
I'll start with FREE... popcorn, peanuts in the shell, great people, and music - yes, live music for FREE.  And, it's all good. Now, to elaborate...

I live in Lawrenceville and crossing a river to go to a place in Pittsburgh is nearly unheard of. But, the people here are so awesome, I can't stay away.  Young, old, hippies, hipsters, locals, and happen-uponers all converging to create an amazing atmosphere.  Last night, there was a woman and her family from Seattle in addition to the familiar faces I usually see.  As other reviewers mentioned, it is like CHEERS - it only takes a couple of visits before folks on both sides of the bar know your name and you!  

Of course the free snacks are awesome, they're free - and you can just toss your peanut shells wherever you'd like (my mom would be horrified to watch me throw them on the floor :)  BUT, THE MENU... WOAH.  Zamir makes his own hummus, falafel, tabuouli, and golani.  OMG it's ALL FABULOUS!  Last week I tried the golani platter for the first time -- a golani patty, hummus, feta, and tomatoes, served with pita.  The golani made me smile - spinach, carrots, spices, cheese -- it makes you want to eat your veggies!  I really had to decide last night between the golani platter and the Peace in the Middle East (tabouli, hummus, falafel, pita).  I was really craving the ""falafel master"" delicacy, so Peace it was.

Beer. Um, there is a lot of it... imports, crafts, and domestics.  If you can't find something to drink here then you must not be thirsty.  I think there are 20 taps... I've never actually counted, but a chalkboard boasts their fine selection (stop in and count them, and let me know).  I'm a micro dork and have always been completely overwhelmed by my choices during any given beer season.  Also, there is a ""worst beer"" (it's never bad) discounted selection and some ""last chance"" items that are usually around $4/bottle or glass. 

Now, music can be a tricky thing. But like everything else here, it's never steered me away.  Every Wednesday is a bluegrass jam in the rear of the establishment.  Mostly it's members of the Shelf Life String Band, but they are often joined by folks who just want to sit in and play.  You may hear some bluegrass versions of Radiohead, The Coasters, Gorillaz in addition to ""trad-grass"" favorites.  Every Friday night there is live music by local and touring musicians and, like the popcorn and peanuts, IT'S ALWAYS FREE!

Bring your appetite and your friends down for a night of great company and amazing atmosphere... I'm fairly certain that you won't be disappointed!",0,YRDKsBFYP7G0E8BLJKIkvA,0,5,2012-10-18,review,0

I love the look of this place. It's so Pittsburgh. (In a fun architecture way, not a dive bar way)  There was a good crowd for the music, but we were still able to get a table with a big group.  
As other Yelpers have pointed out, there's free popcorn and peanuts you can help yourself to.  They have a small menu, but the food is good.  We split an order of the hummus. YUM!  A couple friends ordered some sandwiches and they looked really yummy.  The beer selection is quite good, we all ordered some seasonals from various microbreweries.
They do have TVs, so you are able to catch a game and grab a bite if you are in the mood.  
We had a server who was efficient despite being slammed once the music started. I give her mad props, b/c I was not without a beer throughout the entire set.  That scores major points in my book.  I noted that people also seemed to be getting drinks at the bar timely as well.

The free popcorn and peanuts were a nice touch.

As for the bluesgrass jam night I can't really recommend it. I was worried that it would be a bunch of hipsters standing in a circle pretending to be the Lumineers, and it was.

The food is solid, albeit limited due to their small kitchen space. I would recommend the hummus more than anything else. It's the one that that's stood out to us on our visits. Everything else is decent, but nothing special.

My one complaint is the cost of the whisky. I think Laphroaig 10 was $15 for a pour. That's way too pricey for a 10 year old Scotch that's only $50/bottle across the street at the Wine & Spirits. Otherwise, the beer selection is decent, as well as their limited, but decent bourbon selection.

Self-service peanuts and popcorn are in the back -- it's a lot more sanitary than the typical stuff sitting on the counters in dive bars across Pittsburgh. 

Zamir, the owner, is legitimately the most personable guy I've ever met in the bar scene. The guy genuinely cares about the experience he's providing for you, especially with his food.

The food is simple and tasty and the beer selection is great. Not sure what you want? Jeremy or one of the other super friendly and knowledgeable bartenders will give you a taste and help you decide. Not hungry enough for dinner but want some snacks with your beer? Peanuts and popcorn are on the house. Trivia on Tuesdays and Bluegrass on Wednesdays are both a great time. Finally, I cannot say enough about the service here. Z and his staff are friendly and attentive. They go out of their way to make you feel at home and get your served quickly.

DJEMTgcPO5O6qQA1eWNLSw,SjQlBXUU3BSQhiBfR5RxaA,"More of a 3.5, but definitely not a 4 in my opinion. After living in Pittsburgh for 10 years, 4+ of which have been spent on the North Side, I finally stopped in after reading reviews and passing by this bar a hundred times.

I arrived on a Friday night a few minutes after they opened. Aside from the bartender and another guy who I came to realize was the owner, I was the only person there. Shortly thereafter the place started filling up with a mostly younger crowd.

I ordered a beer and enjoyed the free peanuts while I waited for my boyfriend to arrive. It took a couple minutes for me to become comfortable throwing the shells on the ground, but then it was a lot of fun to do.

When the bf arrived, we ordered some food. The menu is pretty small, but we found something that we would each enjoy. He had a burger with sweet potato fries and their gyro, I ordered the hummus. 

Be prepared for a wait. It wasn't until after I ordered that I saw a mention on the bottom of the menu asking for patience as the food is prepared. Yah, we waited about 30 minutes as the only person preparing all the food is the owner. By the way, the food prep area is close to the bar. I figured this out after I kept hearing a microwave go off every minute. 

The hummus was served with two, warm pitas (not sliced). I didn't dislike the taste, but didn't love the hummus. I'll instead stick with hummus from Alladin's . The boyfriend noted that he enjoyed the burger and gyro, although the gyro didn't look like a traditional gyro one would usually order. I tried his sweet potato fries and again wasn't thrilled.

We'll likely give them another try sometime soon, but might stick to eating somewhere else first or only grabbing an appetizer here.

DJEMTgcPO5O6qQA1eWNLSw,b_9o5lYCnj1XXqGovVIATw,"Stopped in to The Park House on a recent Tuesday evening. The place was pretty full with people participating in their weekly Trivia night. Although it looked like a lot of fun, we didn't take part.

My boyfriend was hungry and thirsty. I was just thirsty

Although it was only around 9 in the evening, the majority of people were drinking - not eating. As I mentioned in my first review of this restaurant, the menu is pretty small. Also, all of the food is pretty much prepared by the owner at one end of the bar. He uses microwaves to heat up just about everything. The food isn't bad, it's just not great and there's absolutely nothing special about it. So, do yourself a favor and come here for beer.

My boyfriend ordered the gyro and hummus platter. I noticed that the tzatziki sauce had been sitting out uncovered and underneath a hot light for a significant amount of time before finally being covered by the owner. I found this to be a bit gross, especially since there is dairy in the sauce. By the way, we learned that the sauce is not homemade, but is doctored up by the owner.

The hummus platter came with two warm (microwaved) pitas. The owner noted that he makes his own hummus. It was pretty tasty, but definitely wasn't a plentiful portion.

What I didn't like about this experience at The Park House was that the owner was eating food behind the counter (with gloves) and seemed to be preoccupied with a woman that was sitting near us. I wanted to say something to him about eating with his gloves on, but I felt extremely awkward.

We'll continue to come here, but in the future we will pass on the food.",0,YRDKsBFYP7G0E8BLJKIkvA,0,3,2015-08-19,review,0

hlpHSNcosmjXQ-gfGXFGRw,oGO9l7RcsUqgW0vHN9Qv4w,"Came here for the second time since last winter... and the feel was completely different. It is not in the best part of town firstly- there are people in front of it begging for money, some people ask you for ""squares"" which I found out are cigarettes- point being I know  cannot dock the restaurant for that- BUT management can take measures to keep the people from being right in front of their door. 

Came here on a Tuesday night after a kickball game with my team- I talked this place up because the last time I was here the food, drink, and atmosphere was awesome. This time... not so much. 

The bar is understaffed, those who are seated wait like 7-10 minutes to get their drinks; as a bar that serves food- the bartender came to our table like one time every 15-20 minutes; because they have 2 people working here-where it needed to be at least 3-4. 

Anyway, it was trivia night when we came here. The trivia, complementary popcorn, and peanuts definitely were an up side that made waiting for drinks and food somewhat better. Their selection of drinks here is superb which is also a big plus. 

I ordered 2 orders of falafel without bread; after a long period of time (45 mins) I went to the bartender and asked her about my falafel orderS she only put in an order for one and gave it to somebody else... 

All I can say was I was disappointed. But I have been here when there was a band, good service, and really fun atmosphere- I hope its better next time.",1,YRDKsBFYP7G0E8BLJKIkvA,1,3,2015-10-28,review,1

As part of a black and white photography class, I needed to pick up film and photo paper, among a few other things.  While Bernie's had everything I needed (and lots of other supplies) I didn't feel all that appreciated for coming in.  I spent a couple hundred bucks and felt like I was being shuffled out the door as quickly as possible.

I will give the one guy at the counter some credit because a woman right before me asked to get a roll or two of film developed in just barely an hour.  I could tell he wanted to get to it quickly, but still felt like I was hassling the guy just being there.

I cannot even begin to tell you how above and beyond they went to make sure I was satisfied with this (small and inexpensive) purchase.  When my friend arrived here in Atlanta with the flash he bought there, it did not work.  So I contacted Bruce and he asked me to ship it back and he would get it working.  Well, for this small purchase, he replaced the nickel-cad battery (specially ordered), replaced most of the innards, tested it on my camera, switched out the charger and shipped it back to me.  At no cost.  I know for a fact that they made no money on me.  But in this process, Bruce created a customer for life.  I am in their debt.  Don't walk.  Run to Bernie's.

0UE3dWo3ANVj5SoMa0xq_Q,1leQwMeTgdshFTD1xyNhlQ,"I had a totally mixed experience with Bernie's, which may explain the other reviews. 

I have a DSLR that I got from my father - it had never been cleaned or adjusted. It had been having some trouble with the battery, so I took it to the only place in Pittsburgh (apparently) that will help with this. A dark-haired guy greeted me as I walked in and treated me like a total noob, and his demeanor made me feel like the dirt under his shoes. However, he did give me good information and service about my camera when prompted by another man in the shop (who I might assume is Bernie). 

They told me they could send it to the manufacturer where they'd clean it for a couple hundred bucks, but instead they cleaned out the sensors and the lens right there at the counter and checked the contacts between the lens and the camera. The dark-haired guy showed me through a magnifying glass what I was looking at, and explained that some spots I saw in the viewfinder were inside the top of the camera and wouldn't appear on the pictures. The other guy (Bernie?) explained to me some of the functions of the camera -- I knew these already, but it was nice to hear them explained and he showed me a few examples. They advised me to get a UV filter to protect my lens, which I knew was overpriced but I happily bought anyway to pay for their service. 

So I think the kind of experience you get depends entirely on the person you run into. I can see how someone would be put off by the dark haired guy I ran into first, and how someone would absolutely love the service from the other guy. All in all I'm pleased with my encounter with this shop, but I probably won't buy anything from there considering how overpriced it was -- however, if something goes wrong or I need any service, I'll definitely go back.",0,bockWFDA3mzjuujY7tOcaw,0,3,2013-07-06,review,0

After a quick search, I came across Bernie's, a sadly dying breed of actual photography stores.  I was worried that the selection wouldn't be adequate, but when I got there, my concerns were put to rest.  Not only did they have exactly what I was looking for (and much more), but it was also competitively priced. After solving my immediate problem, a salesman Joe came up to me and asked if I needed any further assistance.  I happened to also be in the market for a few more items and was able to intelligently discuss the products.  Why?  Because Joe, like the other salespeople, is not just a salesman, but also a photographer. I noticed another customer who was new to photography was receiving quality advise from an exceedingly patient salesman, showing that they are not elitist but inviting about photography. They know their stuff and are very helpful.  The best part about a store like Bernie's is that potential buyers of usually expensive equipment can actually get a look at and feel for products before they buy them.

I don't regularly shoot digital, so I need a 'real' camera shop to either process or send out my film rolls for negatives. But to be fair, I may as well go to Filmmakers and use their darkroom to process the film myself. First of all, they do not have their own darkroom at Bernie's, and therefore have to send it out and it takes sometimes over a week. Secondly, I've stressed to them in the past that I wanted negative scans and not prints. But 9/10 they give me prints anyway. If you shoot with a Sony, Panasonic, Leica, etc, they are more than likely not to carry any accessories for it. They have mostly Canon and Nikon accessories; most of their lenses are used and rather pricey compared to others. 
Pros: variety of lenses (for a price), lots of film stock types to choose from, certain specialty accessories or gear not found anywhere else in the city.

ftiAX5vlb42APSH8ixdqqw,bSO5dYzQBX9uMn2QUfojVg,"How can there be no reviews of Max's Allegheny? This north side German food institution in Pittsburgh has been around for years and years and has menus that tell you so. They also tell you the story of the north side of Pittsburgh, which I also found interesting. The place itself has a lot of character and looks like it's seen a lot of years there. It's a little weathered, but definitely homey and sturdy.

Randy S. and I headed there post Tazza D'Oro on a Sunday for brunch. It happened to be the same very Sunday the Pens were playing the Flyers in game 7, so all the waitresses were wearing Pens paraphernalia, which definitely added to the experience. On Sunday morning it has a brunch buffet with all the standards, plus a healthy dose of Germanic add ons like German farmers breakfast (eggs, sausage and gravy-ed potatoes), red cabbage, pork chops, sauerkraut and potato pancakes. 

The brunch buffet is in a room with a giant tapestry of Neuschwanstein behind the guys at the omelet bar. If that's not rad, I don't know what is. We told the waitress we were going in, went and got back and sat down to find our two ice teas on the table in mason jars (always dope). 

The food was just what you would expect in Pittsburgh: gut busting. It wasn't artisinal or fancy, healthy or particularly remarkable, but it was pretty fonking good and to eat that food in that restaurant really made me feel like I was in Pittsburgh.

sYonLXU0zgZGGaRDJRPxXw,nVVl8xL4CIQfIygXnzvhGQ,"Despite living in PIttsburgh for most of my life, I've somehow managed to never eat at Max's Allegheny Tavern until recently.  

My initial impression of the restaurant was positive - the place had an old neighborhood feel to it, a small crowd was drinking at the end of the antique hardwood bar, and the German murals on the walls made me crave an icy-cold German lager with a stout head of foam.  I thought about how well German potato salad would taste with that beer.  So I grabbed a seat at the bar and eagerly awaited the first taste of my beer.

And I waited...and waited...and waited some more - for over 15 minutes before someone came around to take the order.  Actually that isn't quite accurate.  Two employees came around - one to the end of the bar, and one behind the bar directly opposite me.  Both of them stared at me.  Neither one greeted me or asked me what I would have like to order.  I stared back, incredulously, and even made a ""what's going on here"" palms-extended-upward-shoulder-shrug gesture.  Neither one took the hint.

Finally a third employee came around the bar and took my order.  Great, I thought to myself, finally that beer.  She served the beer in a Mason jar.  WTF?!?  Who serves imported German lager at a German restaurant in a freaking Mason jar?  Max's does.  The beer was devoid of its head, likely the result of a bad beer pour and/or a less than perfectly clean glass (an endemic problem with Pittsburgh restaurants, in my observation).  I was sad.  I quaffed my beer quickly in an attempt to salve my irritation and opened the menu.

My first impression of the menu can be summed as follows: ""Uh-oh"".  The menu is huge with a number of ""slow-food"" stews and braises.  The restaurant is more than half-empty.  How can a restaurant prepare such a large number of menu items, including more than a few labor-intensive dishes, freshly every day and still stay in business when the place isn't even half-full?  Answer: They can't.  The food isn't fresh.

I ordered the Wiener Schnitzel.  I love properly prepared Wiener Schnitzel.  Made with fresh butterflied veal breast, slightly pounded and seasoned, well-coated in fresh bread crumbs, and pan-fried in clarified butter until golden brown on the outside and juicy on the inside, Wiener Schnitzel is the ultimate comfort food.  

Sadly, Max's Wiener Schnitzel had nothing to do with properly prepared Schnitzel.  The veal was super-thin, had a texture that strongly suggested it had been mechanically processed, and tasted as if it was pre-breaded and frozen.  It wasn't pan fried either.  The breaded, frozen, puck was simply dropped into a fryolater - where the breading puffed out and fell off of the meat in places (which doesn't happen when the cutlet is resting against the cooking surface under its own weight as when the dish is properly pan-fried).  The edges of the sad Schnitzel had curled up and it looked a horrible mess on the plate.  Curly Schnitzel?!?  My stomach dropped.

My sides, German potato salad and braised red cabbage, were equally awful.  The German potato salad had an unnatural glossy sheen - the kind that typically comes from bottled sauces that contain high fructose corn syrup.  The ""bacon"" in the dressing was nothing more than tiny flecks of some sort of processed, possibly faux, ""meat"".  The potatoes were suspiciously uniform in thickness and roundness - exactly the homogeneity that is found in pre-peeled, pre-sliced, vacuum-sealed processed potatoes.  It was a gluey, sickly sweet, mess.  I didn't have more than a bite or two.  The braised red cabbage didn't taste fresh - it tasted like it had been sitting in a steam table for a day or two and my order was its last chance to be eaten.  

Max's Allegheny Tavern bills itself on their web site as, ""The Best in German Fare.  The Best in Service"".

That's total bullshit.  It's awful - both for service and fare.

If you want good, authentic, German fare (in which the Schnitzel is properly pan-fried to order and delicious), join the Teutonia Mannerchor down the street.

SVd6Re9tpabo413b4LghYw,3xdZl1rxlH3wSweUAgpL4g,"I like this restaurant so much I had my wedding rehearsal dinner here.  (Both the families liked the food very much.)  Max's is the best German food in Pittsburgh -- actually, it's the best German food I've had outside of Germany, and I've definitely had worse meals in Germany as well.

Max's is in a restored hotel, and the decor is very much in the Victorian style of the original hotel building.  The exception is the bar area that's good for happy hour or watching a game, or just having a beer -- that has a lot of neon and a jukebox.  But the bar area is also tasteful and pleasant to be in.  Max's has a full bar, but their real specialty is their excellent selection of German beers, both in bottles and on tap.

I haven't met a wurst I didn't like, and they're pretty much all offered here.  The Braunschweiger sandwich is pretty delicious and unique in my experience, and the schnitzels are very delicious as well.  Another specialty is the kase spatzle (Spatzle noodles with smoked Gouda cheese -- a twist on mac and cheese that ensures that even a picky child will have something to enjoy here), but my two favorite menu picks here are the hassenpfeffer and the spinach salad with warm bacon dressing.  For sides, the red cabbage salad is my favorite, although the sauerkraut is also very good.  I don't care for the German potato salad, however -- I like the kind that has caraway seeds and vinegar, and is served cold, but Max's offers the kind that has an unidentifiable sauce and is served warm.  Some people like that style of potato salad though, and from what I can tell, Max's does a decent rendition of it.

If you're looking to reserve a room here for a banquet, you have a lot of options.  The basement ""Rathskellar"" is more bar-like in its atmosphere.  It would be a good place for some guys to have a birthday party or something.  For a rehearsal dinner or other formal event, one of the upstairs banquet rooms would be better.  Depending on the size of your group, you can arrange to have a buffet-style dinner, or individuals in the group can order directly off the regular dinner menu.",0,IxQ1ATP_Wg_QujO9nywzcQ,0,5,2009-01-20,review,1

My favorite dinner here is Max's Goulash.  Its a great beef stew with spaetzle and you can get potato pancakes on the side.  The potato pancakes are, without a doubt, the best in Pittsburgh!!

While the food is fantastic, the staff and customer service is what keeps this place from being really excellent.  Its a very ""come as you are"" sort of place and rightfully so as it's a tavern/restaurant but the staff may take the casual nature of the restaurant a little too seriously.

One evening about a year ago, I went in for dinner.  I originally thought to sit at a wooden booth in the bar and there was only 1 open, the last towards the back.  I sat down and the seat completely collapsed on me!  I'm far from what you'd call ""fat"" ""heavy set"" or even a ""big girl"" and the staff just sort of stared at me as though it were my fault that their booth just fell apart, the bartender even laughed at me while I tried to get up.  No one asked if I was ok, no one asked if I needed help and I was generally ignored as I tried to pull myself to my feet.

*I* had to approach the hostess, tell her that the booth had just collapsed and ask to be reseated.  She rolled her eyes at me and told me the dining room was full so I'd have to wait.  

Ok, understandable... could you offer a drink or a manager or something while I waited considering the fact that your booth just broke apart?

The entire incident was either completely ignored by staff, like it never happened or I was looked at like it was my fault.  I didn't even get so much as an apology!

I've been back a couple of times since then because the food is always good but I always sit in the dining room now which is sort of a shame because I actually like the bar atmosphere better.  

Luckily for me though, their menu is online and they offer take out.  Unfortunately, they have the hostess answering those phone calls and since she's not a server, she doesn't have a lot of knowledge about the menu.  When I asked for a total, I was put on hold for a couple of minutes.  She finally came back and I asked how long and was put on hold again so she could go ask the kitchen.  She was quite rude about it, like I was bothering her.

Bottom line: Max's *is* the best place for German food in Pittsburgh, hands down.  But, the food is the only thing you're going for.  The staff could use some help on customer service.",1,IxQ1ATP_Wg_QujO9nywzcQ,1,3,2011-04-06,review,0

We both ended up ordering Max's Goulash that was suggested by another Yelper! You can't go wrong when you have that recommendation. This is not our small town neighborhood goulash made from egg noodles and a mix with ground beef. The noodles in this feast were homemade and chunky, piled high with a peppery meaty sauce infused with fall off the fork beef, carrots, peas, and tiny pearl onions.

I ordered a special, which apparently changes at weekly or monthly.

Crumbled crackers topped this concoction that tastes eerily like my grandmother's. She is Italian by the way. The mac and cheese has a variety of 3 different sausages sliced: knackwurst, bratwurst, and Weisswurst. The portion was large! I had to take home about 1/3 of my meal. Maybe the breads and side salad filled me up. :) In my opinion, it was good but doesn't do well as a leftover.

Where most people associate Hofbrauhaus with the ultimate German beer-hall experience, I prefer Max's for the quieter, less raucous environs. (At least when it's not Oktoberfest)

We'd been there once before and immediately fell in love with the place. I (still) keep raving about the Sausage and Cheese platter. They've got some good Gouda. The Potato Pockets (pierogies) were OK -- I'd take some Pierogies Plus or Forgotten Taste over Max's, but that's just me.

The spaetzel was to die for, however. It's like a German Mac n' Cheese. And boy, do I love me some Mac n' Cheese. It literally melts in your mouth with its' ooey-gooey-ness.

Drink-wise, I tried their German lager and Thom tried the sampler. Thom is a beer enthusiast. For around eight bucks, you get a GOOD amount of beers to try -- they are not some dinky little shot glass samples, either. Thom had some trouble near the end finishing it...it was so much beer. Bob had a Captain and ginger-ale...in a king-size goblet. Goblets are the ONLY way to serve adult bevvies.

For dinner, I had the pork loin over an apple-raisin gravy/bread concoction. The pork loin was flavorful and tender, and quite delicious. Sara had the sauerbraten and seemed to enjoy it. Bob's burger was ginormous and looked extra tasty.

We finished it off with the Apple Fritters. Now, these fritters aren't for the faint of heart. And they aren't your average dinky small sized portions, either. You get two huge deep fried apple fritters, covered in vanilla ice cream. One person CANNOT eat the whole serving. You must, I repeat MUST share them. If you attempt to eat the whole plate yourself, you will have flavor explosion, followed by severe heartburn. But damn, are they GOOD.

Its a bit pricey (~$15/person), but the quality and quantity is superb.  The service is pretty good.  The atmosphere has a nice feel to it, perhaps its the antiquity.. I love the cuckoo clock and tapestries they have.

Now, to the food:
The bread they give you... with apple butter!! ... is very fresh and tasty.  Try not to fill up on it while waiting on your huge main course.. The Bavarian soft pretzels were warm and soft when we ordered them.  Also delicious.

The sampler platter is a great deal if you don't know yet what you like.  You get 3 entrees and the typical sides for ~$16.  My favorite, though, is the schnitzel liechtenstein, with sauerkraut and potato pancakes.  Fresh and delicious everytime.

I would definitely recommend this place to anybody who likes ethnic, or German/Bavarian food, or just trying new stuff.  It's awesome.",0,IxQ1ATP_Wg_QujO9nywzcQ,0,5,2012-06-03,review,0
9Ify25DK87s5_u2EhK0_Rg,aeZvQwzxFcBFVYEo31WGxA,"Max's is a great place for German food.  I've had several sandwiches, most of the appetizers and even the Sunday brunch (which has a good spread but can be hit or miss) -  though not all in one visit.

I most recently took my Mom out for dinner using a Living Social deal I had.  Somehow, even though we have both been to Max's quite a few times before neither of us had ever seen the sampler platter option on their menu.  For just a bit more than the cost of the regular entrees, you can choose three entrees and two sides.  Obviously the portions of each selection are smaller than the individual meals, but the size is still generous and there were only a couple things not available for the sampler platter.  Between the two of us we selected six different items and four different sides to try and shared everything - and still had enough left for a full meal each the next day.  I can't even decide on my favorite of all the items we tried.  If you aren't sure about some of the entrees, this is a great way to see what you like.  I personally loved everything so much that I think my new go-to menu item from now on will be the sampler platter.  Not being forced to choose just one item is what living in America is all about.

All together I think our bill was around $35 (no alcoholic beverages consumed).  Some might consider this a tad pricey but the food is so good I usually don't mind the slightly higher cost.  Service has never been a problem for me in fact they've always been helpful when I have questions about the menu.  Full bar with numerous good beers on tap.

I really had no clue what they offered for brunch options, but quickly learned they have a a pretty decent size brunch buffet.  I'm not below buffets at all, it's the fat kid in me!  Most things still looked a little questionable to me, but I went for the big ticket items.  Make your own omelets, potato pancakes and dessert.  I'd hit up the buffet again, but still be hasty to check out the regular menu again.  

The omelet was made right in front of you, so I added cheese, mushrooms, peppers, tomatoes and onions.  I was super excited about it because it was the size of a football.  Sadly, it was pretty tasteless.  I don't think they added any salt or pepper to the egg mix, so it came out really bland, despite loading up on ingredients.  

But the potato pancakes... I could survive on them forever.  They were amazeballs!  Add some sour cream and I was in potato patch heaven!  I had to keep myself from getting more because of the other thing I loaded up on... dessert.  

The desserts looked unassuming, but they were also awesome.  I had a smattering of delectable bites.  The scones were so moist and tasty.  I had to stop myself from taking more than 20.  I also had some carrot cake, brownies, cookies among other things I inhaled and didn't pay attention too.  Should I be embarrassed?  Probably.

It is fantastic, although there are two menu items that are inedible.  DO NOT ORDER THE CHICKEN VIENNESE, OR THE GOULASH.

I absolutely LOVE this place.  I always get the Sampler Platter and get two knackwurst and a Schnitzel Lichtenstein and then take half of it home.  this review isn't very exciting, bc now I'm thinking about how I was Schnitzel Lichtenstein...

Listen I grew up a kleine Madchen in Stuttgart Germany.  I know my German food, and if you are thinking Hoffbrau Haus you are thinking of just one type of german cuisine.  Aside from when Atria's has their Oktoberfest menu, this IS the most authentic German food in Pittsburgh.

How good is Max's?

It was good enough my German family and I held my sister's rehearsal dinner there.  And they even let us have Polter Abend on the sidewalk outside!  

It is good enough we take our father there for Father's Day.

While the sauce was excellent, the veal was very hard to cut with a knife. It was also not pounded evenly and raw on the thick end. The spatzel was soggy, mushy and not drained properly. It was swimming in water. The rolls must have been refrigerated and were ice cold. The relish and apple butter were great however.  I also do have to say the German potato salad was dynamite. 

We also ordered a spicy bloody mary and were given what tasted like watered down bloody mary mix  and vodka with nothing else in it. It was bad...the you can't drink it kind of bad. We had to spice them up ourselves with Worcestershire and Tabasco plus add salt and pepper to get them to taste OK. 

I will note their servers were excellent. I have no complaints at all about the service!

My husband has eaten there before and was sorely disappointed as well. I don't know if it was a bad day, but I'd be weary of spending another $75 for lunch for 3 people and getting sub par food and a bar that can't pull off a basic drink.

We sat at the bar and had a drink and in what must have been only ten minutes we were asked if we would mind eating at a booth in the bar area rather than wait for the dinning room.  We were thrilled, because we were considering eating at the bar.  The booth worked out just fine.  It wasn't too noisy and  we got served quickly.  Even though there were several specials that tempted us, we both ordered the best thing on the menu - their Jäger Schnitzel, with sides of hot German potato salad and sweet and sour cabbage.  I had a German black lager and my wife a glass of wine.  The basket of assorted rolls comes with delicious apple butter and sauerkraut relish, both very tasty.  The schnitzel is quite large, and we only made it about halfway thru when we asked for a to-go box.  We're looking forward to finishing it here at home.

Q3fFv_ft17OyV-NRF1iQxw,k9lh3a3yUZy0heXsfxPR_Q,"After hearing Hofbrauhaus-haters say that Max's Allegheny Tavern is the only place to go in Pittsburgh for German food, my husband and I decided to finally try the restaurant this afternoon.

We were seated in little booths right next to the bar. They were cozy, but the seats reminded me of old fashioned church pews. Our waitress soon brought us a little basket of four rolls with butter, sauerkraut relish, and apple butter. Though I liked the different varieties of bread, it was nothing special. The relish and apple butter were a nice touch though.

Our waitress was busy with both waiting tables and tending the bar, but she managed to check on us pretty frequently. Our food also came out relatively promptly. I order the Wiener Schnitzel with Potato Pancakes and Spatzle on the side. The Wiener Schnitzel was amazing -- by far the best I've ever had! The veal was tender and the fried surface was perfectly crispy. However, the sides sadly did not match this main dish. The Potato Pancakes were oddly bitter, and I did not enjoy them with either the sour cream or applesauce. I only ate two or three bites and completely stopped eating them. (I must add that Hofbrauhaus's potato pancakes are delicious and something that I order every time that I go there.) I also did not enjoy the Spatzle, but I am accustomed to eating cheese Spatzle.... So I may be reviewing this harshly since I'm just not used to plain Spatzle, but in my opinion, it was terribly bland and watery.

Overall, Max's Allegheny Tavern served one incredible item (Wiener Schnitzel), but everything else was merely mediocre. Because of this, I really don't plan on returning to the restaurant again any time soon. I'll be sticking with the fun environment and overall good food at Hofbrauhaus, actually.",0,IxQ1ATP_Wg_QujO9nywzcQ,0,3,2012-11-04,review,1

         When will I ever learn. I really want to like this place. It's a cool building with neat old fashion feel to it. But the food is mediocre at best.The last time I was there I got what they called German goulash. I have had this made for me by real German cooks so I have a good idea what it's supposed to taste like and this isn't it. It was made from pork instead of beef with frozen peas and carrots. The gravy wasn't a rich and savory, it was canned or packaged with I don't even know what spices in it. When I complained to the waitress she said that most people don't like it either. She asked me if I wanted something else but I was in a hurry and ate the meat after I scraped the gravy off of it. I have been to this place 1 or 2 times a year and I have had undercooked potato pancakes, greasy rubins and cold sausages. The only thing I can say is really good is the spinach salad with warm bacon dressing. It is a bit over priced for the size, but it is always really good.

A neighbor talked me into going here for the brunch and I was glad she did. For an all you can eat brunch they do a nice job keeping things stocked and fresh.

My partner has been in the basement before for various work-related functions, but I had never been there, despite driving by on numerous occasions. 

    We easily found on-street parking and entered the restaurant. I immediately loved the decor in the entry room/bar area, and those pleasant furnishings continued into the more intimate rear room where we were seated. We enjoyed the beautiful wall tapestries, and I thought the old newspaper-like menus were pretty cool! I was surprised (in a good way) at the old-fashioned urinals in the men's room. In a city that has struggled to nourish and revitalize its history over the years I was already a fan of how unique Max's was in the regard of feeling ""authentic"" in an era of predictable chains.

     We were initially enticed by the prospect of ordering fried soft pretzels stuffed with cheese as a shared appetizer only to find out they were not available. We settled for the non-cheese-stuffed version, which were ""melt in your mouth"" good and were handsomely complemented by tangy honey mustard. We were a bit dehydrated after walking miles around the city, yet our waitress was very attentive in consistently replenishing our water glasses as soon as they were half-empty. I was craving a burger but was tempted instead by the fried fish sandwich, which I ordered with a side of potato pancakes and applesauce. My partner ordered a fried chicken sandwich with the same side I did. 

    Our food arrived surprisingly promptly. My fish sandwich was HUGE! I had enough to take home and enjoy for a post-work meal the following evening. The fish tasted fresh, although I wasn't a fan of having to pick small bones out of my mouth in exchange for enjoying that freshness. The bread it was served upon was tasty as well. The potato pancakes were thick, fresh, and were delicious when enjoyed with the chunky applesauce. My partner also thoroughly enjoyed his own sandwich.

Some of my rotating favorites on the buffet include red cabbage, Eggs Benedict, and the Farmer's Breakfast.  You can order off the menu during brunch if you aren't in mood to gorge yourself on the buffet.  No drinks included with the buffet :( but you can order them, of course.

I love the decor at Max's - it's an old house, and much of the furniture looks like it was in this house and just remained when it converted to a restaurant.  Max's location in Old Deutschtown on the North Side fits it perfectly.  They even offer a shuttle to Heinz Field on Steeler game days (small fee applies).",1,IxQ1ATP_Wg_QujO9nywzcQ,0,3,2013-12-11,review,2
2UC3rwRm6swuNFt_GhKOhw,nBgtMQMnRGzVQ5vk9en9vQ,"This is one of the only German restaurants I know of in the area. The meal was good and reasonably priced. They also have a good beer selection on draft and in bottles. We had a party of 6 going for a 7:30 dinner on a Thursday. 

Bigger parties tend to chat a little more and take longer in my experience. I felt like they were sort of rushing us out. That might be because they closed the dining room door and started vacuuming the front bar room while we were still finishing up our dinner. I'm not sure if anyone was eating out there but I'm very happy we weren't because it seems really gross to me to vacuum around food. This was around 9:15 and I'm pretty sure they serve until 10. 

Besides that, our service was good and so was the food. We all split the stuffed pretzels and potato skins as an appetizer. The pretzels are delicious, I could have eaten them all myself! Deep-fried and stuffed with cheese, yummy! 

I ordered the Chicken Viennese and was pleased with my meal. It came with a choice of two sides and I went with a delicious sweet potato casserole and my favorite thing of the night: POTATO PANCAKES. I prefer sour cream, but you can also get applesauce. Yum yum yum get lots of potato pancakes! The chicken was delicious and was served over spaetzel, which was just ok. I've had the kase spaetzel there before which is served in a cheese sauce and much better than the regular. 

There was a variety of entrees ordered from sausage platters to wiener schnitzel and everyone seemed pleased with their meals. You get a lot for your money and I'll never turn down a chance to eat potato pancakes!",0,IxQ1ATP_Wg_QujO9nywzcQ,0,3,2013-12-15,review,1

yzUm9CgzEt_5kZ5nStS7yw,gHKXQT4xVWohNGkCR6swog,"Why you should trust my review: I am German. I've been to Germany. I LOVE German food. And German beer. 

The bar is awesome. Wish we had more time just to chill and drink. But our waitress was awesome, attentive and knowledgeable! Order a REAL beer. Something on tap from Germany. (If not, I'll give you dirty looks from behind my coffee cup.)

What you should order: The Sampler Platter. Pick three amazing entrees, two awesome sides. Brilliant for $16.95... best deal on the menu. And if they have a meatball appetizer you want this. You do. 

So which entrees: 
 - Schnitzel. Whichever one you're drooling over. Personally Jager Schnitzel is always best because God blessed the world when he made mushrooms, and man praised God by making mushroom sauce.
 - Leberkase. Wow. This was fantastic. It's like a cross between liverwurst (but NOT made with liver) and a meatloaf. Fantastisch.
 - Weisswurst. It was good. I've had better and yes I know its a German faux pas to have weisswurst at any other time of day than a midmorning snack... however. it was still yummy and I happily moaned with each bite i consumed with mustard.

So which sides: 
 - Spaetzle! Buttery goodness. Never had it or heard of it? Think little dumplings. In butter. Es ist wunderbar.
 - Sauerkraut... they make theirs with sausage. what?! Ja... mmmmm.
 - Potato Pancakes. You order these with applesauce. you hear me? applesauce.

What to avoid... that's pretty harsh but they lost a star for a reason:
 - German Potato Salad was too sweet and soupy. My great grandma's recipe puts this to shame.
 - IF you don't like mustard (weirdo) the Sauerbraten has a mustard sauce. I like it, but others don't. You've been warned.

We walked here from the ballpark... took about 15 minutes. Worth the walk both ways and they treated us well despite me wearing a Cardinals shirt in a foreign land.

This place has been an institution for my family, and I really love it here.  I feel like this is some of the only German food in Pittsburgh, and I think it represents fairly well.  My thoughts:

Brunch Buffet- I love the Sunday brunch buffet more than life.  Omelette station, German and American breakfast and lunch foods, and lots and lots of beautiful, delicious, and decadent desserts.  It's heaven on Earth.  There is usually a decent selection of meats, and the potato pancakes are almost always featured.  They've changed it a bit over the years, but I still love this buffet.

Appetizers- My family loves the soft pretzels.  They are so yummy and buttery, but a bit heavy if you are going to eat your entire meal.  So make sure to share.

Meals-  I, personally, have never had a bad meal here.  The sauasages of all varieties have been great.  The weinerschnitzel also great.  Sandwiches all good as well.  I really like the cheesy spaetzle dish that is just like macaroni and cheese but with spaetzle noodles!  I don't get too crazy and order anything complicated, though.

Sides-  I love love love their sides.  I could live on the spaetzle and potato pancakes.  Don't pass the sides up!

Dessert:  Also love their desserts.  There is a chocolate chocolate cake that they heat up with homemade whipped cream that is TO DIE FOR.  Not so shockingly, the apple strudel is wonderful as well.

Besides the food, the servers are always very friendly and efficient.  There is also ample street parking, which is really nice.  Definitley check this place out if you have not yet.",4,IxQ1ATP_Wg_QujO9nywzcQ,3,4,2014-06-03,review,6

The restaurant is located in a tired part of town. It isn't in a bad area, but I'm not sure how I would feel eating there after dark. When you walk in you walk through the tavern portion of the restaurant, which is dark and gloomy. We were escorted to the rear of the tavern, which is covered in B&W pictures from the 40's, which gives it a old world tired feeling.

The menu choices were standard faire for a true german restaurant. I had Max's Goulash, which said it came with spaetzle, but it is piled in the bottom of the bowl and not on the side, which was okay. The goulash was too vinegary for my tastes, but it was okay.

But now that relative has gone senile and needs to go to a nursing home, and they can't cook anymore.

For the past two years, every time we come here we say, ""This just isn't as good as I remember.""  For starters, the food is always served cold.  Don't believe me?  I hope you enjoy tepid knackwurst and cold mashed potatoes.

BTW, to whoever makes their mashed potatoes, you have to boil the potatoes before you mash them.  Yesterday they were undercooked, gritty, and gross.

In fact, all of the food is becoming gross.  My friend got the roasted beef and what came out looked like a cold cut covered with a congealed beef gravy that had bits of carrots in it.  wtf was that????

I'm done.  This place has gone down hill.  You need a new chef, immediately.  Max's is a North Side institution but there are so many new, better restaurants opening up that they really need to up their game.

We tried the sausage and cheese sampler appetizer and it was simplicity at it's finest - fresh, delicious sausage, rich cheeses, and an excellent mustard for dipping. I was really impressed with how such a simple appetizer could convey the quality of their food so well. Delicious!

The entrees were equally as tasty. I tried a turkey reuben which came on a potato pancake. Obviously, this particular entree was not the most traditional German faire, but, once you took a bite, there was no going back. A variety of sides were available; I tried the spaetzle - also very simple, but delicious.

Overall, this is a great place - cozy vibe, excellent German food (both traditional and more adventurous), and quick, friendly service. My only regret is not having room to try their tempting desserts. We don't get to the Deutschtown neighborhood often, but we will have to make it a point to go back for Max's Allegheny Tavern.",0,IxQ1ATP_Wg_QujO9nywzcQ,0,4,2015-07-16,review,0

The bread that comes with entrees is delicious (pumperknickel + others), and their cherry sauer kraut is delicious as well.

The food is good, but you must be careful with certain dishes. One of the schnitzels that comes with carrots/peas is clearly bedecked in carrots & peas that were recently frozen.

It had lots of sauerkraut, Swiss cheese, and sauce with the meat piled high. It is one of the best Reubens I have ever had. The chips were thinly sliced and very crispy. There was no need for a dipping sauce, the chips were very good just plain. They had 3 or 4 desserts that looked good but I chose the German Chocolate cake. It's one of my very favorite desserts.

For apps we had the  Bavarian nachos (not great by any means and actually very odd...and cold), the stuffed fried pretzel and the red cabbage with sausages. The red cabbage here is amazing, and the pretzel was fairly good with a honey mustard dipping sauce...but I guess its kind of hard to mess up something thrown into a deep fryer and stuffed with cheese. For our entrees I had their ""famous"" potato pancake Reuben with sides of red cabbage (couldn't get enough!) and their house German potato salad - also very tasty. Fiance had potato pancakes, spatzel with cheese sauce and sausages. The spatzel was not in as a creamy a cheese sauce as I would have hoped - it was a bit oliy, not so much creamy. We were both a little underwhelmed sans the cabbage with the entire meal. I hate to say it - but I have had better authentic German style food at church potlucks and even Hofbrahaus (in a comparison to the beers at Hofbrahaus - these did just not stack up for me).

The interior has the look and feel of what comes to mind when thinking of a European pub. The staff is warm and courteous and the service is top notch. I got waited on promptly and lunch was in front of me within ten minutes of my ordering it. 
 
My meal today consisted of one of the items on the ""February Specials"" list. It was breaded veal on a plate smothered in a brown mushroom gravy (think Jäger Schnitzel and substitute veal for pork) with Hot German Potato Salad, Sauerkraut and some homemade rolls. Delicious!
 
My only disappointment was that I came here for lunch on a work day and couldn't include one of the German imports thas was on tap.  They have (notably) Hacker-Pschorr Weisse, Hacker-Pschorr Munich Gold, Köstritzer Schwarzbier, Warsteiner Pils.

Max's is famous for it's wurst and indeed the weisswurst is the best dish: iconic, simple, and satisfying. The beer sampler is a great partner to the weisswurst. Combined, the diner, whether they are visitors or not, feel like they've experienced a staple of Pittsburgh locals. Thus with this wurst and beer combo, arguably, one of the most famous Pittsburgh dishes is now at your fingertips. Furthermore, if you want to take the next step in your Pittsburgh eating experience, Max's again has you covered with the Hasenpfeffer, or rabbit dish. An ode to the deep German roots of Pittsburgh's North Side, this traditionally rural, hunter's dish is served at Max's breaded and with gravy on top and with two sides: this reviewer recommends potato pancakes, spätzle, or substitute the einlauf soup, which goes well with the dark pumpernickel bread served table side. While the meat is thick and tender, the breading conceals the possibility of herbs and spices, which if they do exist, cannot be detected. Additionally, the Hasenpfeffer is a little pricey since you pay for the uniqueness; it is often only a dinner item as well. Finally, an Iron City Beer may be the best way to cap off a Pittsburgh North Side German dining experience at Max's bar: a place where many a long hard day has been passed knocking back a cold one.

My friend says the hot and sour soup here is the best she's tasted as well.  I like their pork egg roll but it is pretty different from others.  It is mainly vegetable (Cabbage I believe) and pork.  Their egg drop soup is pretty decent.

I can't say I am impressed with their other dishes.  I've had curry chicken, shrimp fried rice, chicken soup, shrimp egg roll.  They were definitely edible just no where near as flavorful as the beef lo mien.  The chicken soup was horrible.  It was bland and the noodles were lo mien noodles.  Fried rice were ok but I've had much much better at other places.  They have a huge menu though so it'll take some time to go through them.

The obvious bad thing about this place is it is in a ghetto neighborhood.    It is probably not worth making a trip out there but if you're in the neighborhood, I'd say give it a try.

Although the storefront is a bit drab, don't let that deter you from stopping in and picking up some food. On a recent rainy Saturday afternoon, my boyfriend and I made our way over to grab some food. We placed our order., paid and returned about 10 minutes later to pick up the grub.

I was in the mood for wonton soup and wasn't disappointed. Delicious, hot broth with a plentiful amount of wontons was promptly devoured. My boyfriend ordered two different beef and vegetable entrees, which were accompanied by white rice. I tasted some of his meal and agreed with him that it was very, very tasty.

China Taste was so good that we ended up stopping back later in the evening after we hit up the casino. I again ordered the wonton soup (although this time a whole quart). He ordered a quart of the chicken and broccoli. Again, super yummy.

Yep - the place is a whole in the wall, but the employees (the same were there both times) seemed pleasant. Plus, you cannot beat the price for what you get. It's redic cheap.

How I have never noticed it when walking by it on East Ohio Street, not 10 minutes from my house, I will never understand.  Maybe because the entrance is set back from the sidewalk a bit, so it looks dark (i.e. possibly closed) when you first walk by.  Or maybe because it's overshadowed by the Isaly's next door.  Please, I beg of you, fellow Yelpers, don't ignore this place any longer!

Please note, as other reviewers have, that North Shore Deli is cash only.  But believe me, you won't need much.  They do have a website that really just lists the sandwiches they offer and their hours or see my photo of the menu board showing the sandwiches available (all named after local streets).  

It was difficult to decide on just one sandwich.  But after reading the few reviews here, I decided to go with the hot sausage.  When I first arrived, the meat was still cooking.  I didn't mind, I told the gentleman I would return and took a stroll over to Priory for some sweet treats for later.  When I returned, I was the only patron there but was greeted again and friendly small talk ensued.  I opted for a side of macaroni salad as well.  

When I got home and unwrapped my sandwich, I was surprised by the hot sausage that looked like it was exploding at both ends.  And that it was, my friends.  Exploding with flavor, that is.  The ends were crispy and delicious and the sausage was just hot enough that the macaroni salad was the perfect cool salad compliment.

We found a grumpy old man at the front desk, and he could not have been less interested in our arrival. It felt like we were disturbing him to ask for our room key. But the fun started when we returned later in the evening. We found the rollaway we had requested (and paid for) not present, and I went back down to the old gentleman. He stared at me and then went back to pecking at his computer. I waited. Suddenly he looked up at me and started yelling, something to the effect that there wasn't anything that he could do, and that he would see if someone could do something but probably not. He also angrily admitted that the reservation did show the rollaway.

I slunk away with my guest who had by now come down, too, embarrassed and insulted. It shouldn't be this way. If this is personalized service, I'd rather stay at a motel.

Even without grumpy old man, there's nothing special about this place. The rooms were ok, but the bathrooms tiny (I guess they should be called showerrooms). Everything else was sub-par. The dining room breakfast was served in was tacky and the coffee awful. We did not dare try the free wine. The hotel is in a bad neighborhood.

For the money, find a special at the William Penn on the Omni Hotels website. If you want a boutique hotel, try the Inn on the Mexican War Streets--a beautiful building with friendly owners just across from the National Aviary and that beautiful park.

ETEM1dZOu6Qtp6jlzWyOfA,beBv0IaZ4MFp28YVBFNkmA,"My wife and I stayed at The Priory when we went out to Pittsburgh for Superbowl weekend. 

The hotel is beautiful inside and out. We don't normally stay in nice hotels, so we were surprised by how nice it was, especially the extremely comfortable king-sized bed. It made for the perfect romantic getaway in a hectic weekend filled with bars, parties, and souvenir shopping on The Strip.

There are some things you should know before you book at The Priory, however. The hotel is right across the street from a housing project. There isn't enough parking, especially if The Grand Hall is hosting a wedding when you arrive. If you get a room that is street-adjacent you may be woken up by sounds like people talking or shoveling the sidewalk. 

Overall, none of these things bothered me that much (aside from getting woken up by the snow shoveler, but I suppose that was better than cracking my head on an icy sidewalk later!). However, if you're the type of person who gets easily annoyed at minor inconveniences or gets uncomfortable around lots of african-americans, you may want to stay at the Doubletree or Westin or something.

Lots of character, not at all scary, very clean, modern, comfy - all the things you want in a hotel.  Well - the beds COULD be more comfortable.  It amazes me that hotel reviews rarely mention the bed.  To me, that is the most important part.  

The bed:  Too hard, for one thing.  The linens were great, very soft, and the comforter was perfect - light but warm.  However, the headboard was only loosely connected to the bed and - well, let's just say noisy.

We only stayed one night, so can't expand too much.  Breakfast didn't look too appetizing, so we went elsewhere.  The stairs are very squeaky but you can't hear them inside the rooms.  The elevator is great.  The bar was nice - small, but a great place to stop for a nightcap on your way back in for the evening.

nEYPahVwXGD2Pjvgkm7QqQ,kqIta40BR_aBjO1Zavi9Yw,"One thing Pittsburgh is not known for, but should be, is turning old churches into businesses, homes and even bars (gasp!).  Most of the churches are so beautiful that it's such a great use of space.  This is no exception, as it's just so unique inside! 

If you're looking for that nontraditional hotel that's NOT a Marriott or Hilton, this is the place you'll want to stay!  It's fashioned like a European boutique hotel, plus all the amenities you'd be looking for like WiFi, a shuttle and continental breakfast (score!). 

It's also a really lovely place to have an event.  For smaller events you can rent out specific parlor's for a reasonable cost and you're able to bring in your own caterers.  I really like this option because you're not boxed into one choice that may be out of price range.  If I would have gotten married in Pittsburgh, this would  definitely have been my first choice for the reception.  The Grand Hall is just gorgeous!  It has the original church organ and stain glass windows.  When it's all dressed up for the event it's just a stunning place for a magical affair! 

The Northside of town, where it's located, has walkable access to the Andy Warhol Museum, The Mattress Factory Museum, The Children's Museum, The National Aviary, The Carnegie Science Center, PNC Park (home to the Pirates, go bucks!) and Heinz Field (home to the Stillerz, as we call them in the burgh).  Some are farther than others, but there's always the shuttle if it's in our frigid winter season.  In the summer, go for the walk so you can take in the sights!

There's also a lot of cute restaurants and bars on East Ohio River Boulevard, which is two streets up from the hotel.  My suggestions would be Bistro to Go and Bistro Soul, Rita's Italian Ice (personal fave) or The Priory Bakery for dessert!  There's also Legends North Shore not far on E. North Ave. about two streets up from E. Ohio and Amani Coffee Shop and Cafe for a quick stop for coffee or a great panini for lunch.   

It's really a fantastic time to go in the summer because EVERYTHING is within walking distance.  Plus they have a great farmers market in the park right along E. Ohio and they have kayaking in the park right by the Aviary.  The big kayaking organization, Venture Outdoors is right under the 6th St. Bridge next to PNC Park.  You're able to kayak around the three rivers for only $15 an hour!  It's a great way to see the city!

wJl6K7xA_r8iuj5Mp2ngFA,X075uq1d0VzbIwtVojUNNA,"We stayed here and was initially disappointed-- being new to town, our first impression was that Pittsburgh was a very very bad town full of homeless and degenerates (the area, I find out later, is one of the worst spots in the city!).  The hotel is located across the street from a housing authority building.  Projects?  UGH.  Great.  

Then we were put into a ""historical"" room that was similar to that of a rundown cheap apartment-- old shower stall, moldy threadbare carpeting, lumpy squeaky bed.  

I find out an hour later (after freaking out about the lo-end aspect of this room) that they have new rooms that were just recently renovated.  I asked to see the room, and then ultimately change to that room-- for a fee, of course.  About 50% more expensive.  But I pay more because NO WAY would I be able to exist in this old ""historical"" creepy room.  

Finally, a regular room-- the ""renovated"" room was similar to that of an acceptable hotel room.  Why even keep this historical, old, dingy, dirty room?  Do they figure unsuspecting people who don't know any better will just accept it b/c they have no other choice?? 

I slept well in the ""new"" renovated room, and would have been freaked out all night in the old room. What a difference. Actually, the bed and linens were very, very comfortable.  The bathroom was nice and clean.  The room was what I expected a hotel room to be... not high end four seasons, but not cheap and nasty either. 

The hotel obviously had availabilities of the new, renovated rooms, so why put us in an old, unrenovated, ugly old apartment looking room? If they believed in upgrading, then they would have at least gotten repeat business!! For those who are going to book here, pay more for the new rooms, or go somewhere else.  The option of staying in the old room should not be an option at all.  

I don't think I will ever go back here if I ever go back to Pittsburgh.  I will stay at a chain hotel-- marriot or whatever.  What is money except a means to be comfortable and live?  I will spend more next time.

Breakfast was ""eh"".  It was free-- small stations of some fruit, cheese, small pastries, cereal, yougurt and two hot items:  sausage + bacon.  OJ, Cranberry, Milk and Coffee also available.

FtA1QaQkd0KrJ7CEdgENjA,MzlRISoANH-nXGaYO7iBFw,"I liked this hotel, but it is something of a mixed bag. Would I stay there again? Yes, but be sure you have a car and are okay with gritty cities.

Pros:
Beautiful rooms. We stayed in the historical side and had a very nice if not very large room (queen). Some reviewers said they had a mini-frig. Note that not all rooms have those.
Breakfast was nice during the week. 
Hotel was clean.
Awesome, fantastic courtyard. You can eat breakfast out there if the weather is nice. 

Cons:
Location. This is not a nice neighborhood. But you can walk to the Strip district, the Warhol Museum, and the stadium. 
Each room is different. It's a bit like playing the lottery.
VERY small shower.
Breakfast was less on Sunday, as they rely on local bakeries. It's a true continental.
You get yelled at for bringing your own alcohol onto the property. Yeah, we thought that was weird, too. No mention of it on the website, but they don't want you to bring your own drinks into the courtyard.",0,hBAcj7X5JHeX2hvmptwH-w,1,4,2012-06-27,review,0

They immediately switched our room, in fact they upgraded us to a much larger king room. Not bad at all for a free breakfast with a small but nice selection of meats, cheeses, and fresh fruit. The kind gentleman who works in the kitchen/tends to the breakfast buffet even went in the back and found us some water crackers for the Brie, upon request.",0,hBAcj7X5JHeX2hvmptwH-w,0,4,2012-07-18,review,0

The continental breakfast was delicious, the hotel staff was very friendly and helpful, the amenities were wonderful (fast wifi!!). Like others said, it felt more like you were part of a fun community due to the interactions with the staff, the small great bar downstairs, and the welcoming atmosphere.
 The fitness center was well equipped as well, and there was a great complimentary shuttle. The driver would not only take us to restaurants, but would suggest other cool places to visit.

Nice staff, fairly easy walk to North Side or across the bridges but as others have mentioned it's not in a great area.  Literally ""on the wrong side of the tracks"".  I live in a similar area in Philly so it didn't bother me as much but can see this being an issue for others.  I also walked the whole time and didn't use the shuttle so that's an option as well, but did hear others waiting a while to that just to go to PNC Park which I simply walked to myself in 10 minutes.

The continental breakfast buffet was terrific and nicely displayed.

JUnprAEu1n3dGKpN-wE4tQ,D9N7Y4TW6iwmnlGIG7sUKw,"We decided to have a little staycation at the Priory earlier this month.  My husband made the reservation with a special they were having for a dinner date night.  With the special, they give you a few Pittsburgh restaurants to choose from and you get a $50 voucher to that restaurant.  When my husband called the Priory, they said they would make the reservations and call us back on the time.  We never got a call about the reservation time which was annoying.  But the main issue was we checked in, talked to the girl at the front desk about having the shuttle take us to this reservation at Meat and Potatoes, and she set us up with the shuttle.  We go in the room, look around for the $50 voucher, and it's not in the room so we assumed (i know we should never assume) that it was taken care of with Meat and Potatoes when they  made our reservation.  We had a fabulous dinner at M&P, great food, great service, and the bill comes.  We asked the server about this Priory $50 voucher and he had never heard about it so the manager comes over and says they didn't give them anything but to have them call and ask for him and he'll work it out.  We called the Priory and told them this, the girl who answered gave us an attitude and said you should have asked for it.  Then refused to call M&P to talk to the manager.  She just said to pay the full bill and we can work it out when we get back to the hotel.  We gave the manager our phone and he was yelled at as well about this.  He took our word that the Priory would deliver it to him the next day and he deducted the $50 from our bill.  It was embarrassing and it wasn't the issue with the money, just the service with the priory.  This showed us two things: We won't be going back to the Priory due to the lack of service and lack of respect and we WILL be going back to M&P because their service was impeccable.",0,hBAcj7X5JHeX2hvmptwH-w,0,1,2014-09-17,review,1

In spite of the hotel being located in the less-than-revered North Side of the city, the place has charm and character with a friendly, accommodating staff.  At no point did I feel unsafe, although in full disclosure, I did not spend considerable time in the hotel's neighborhood, other than to frequent a nearby watering hole, the James Street Gastropub and Speakeasy.  The hotel has ample complimentary parking nearby (one lot across the street, another around the block), including one lot that is only accessible to hotel guests.  The other lot is posted to only permit hotel guests to park there but there did not appear to be a way to monitor this, although it is possible (likely?) hotel staff does so.  In addition to the friendliness of the staff and shuttle service to the stadium, the continental breakfast that was provided was pleasantly surprising in that in addition to the typical fare (cereal, muffins, danish, hard boiled eggs, coffee, etc.), there was a generous selection of meats, cheeses, and fruits.

bvu13GyOUwhEjPum2xjiqQ,36A-FAQzk_lmetSRSrJWAw,"Inside the old St. Mary's Priory, a beautiful hotel transformed from a real monastery is Monk's Bar. The tiny and I mean very small bar, with three tiny tables and three bar stools is big on properly made drinks. 

I sat at a stool which isn't high enough for the bar which made for a rather uncomfortable seating. My friend Katrina has known the lone bartender, Nikki for years and has been wanting to get me out of my comfort zone and try new places. I beat Katrina to the Priory and found a lot of free parking out front (after 7 pm street parking is free) and went inside. 

Now situated, I sat down and looked over the menu and decided on a Monktini, citron absolute, fresh lime juice and razzmatazz. Perfect for a warm summer night, not heavy or filling, a little sweet, a little tart. Refreshing! After Katrina arrived another couple walked in and sat at one of the small cafe tables, the tiny room induces conversation with others, especially when the bartender introduces you to everyone. 

Time for a bite and this is where Monk's Bar lost a star (the uncomfortably high bar and low stools cost them a star as well) but as a practicing vegan, there were no options I could enjoy. Sandwiches are served on pretzel buns (monks invented pretzels) with options like a ham and turkey club, turkey, creamy chicken salad, and a few others I forgot. I did order hummus but it wasn't filling at all. I did enjoy the house made Lemoncello, although I have made this in the past, Monk's makes there's with grain alcohol which I found to be too strong. I'll continue to make mine with 100 proof vodka and forgo the impending hiccups. 

It was a very interesting night, made new friends, found an interesting new spot and a really cool building I'd love to explore more of. Everyone should try Monk's bar and get out of your comfort zone.",0,hBAcj7X5JHeX2hvmptwH-w,0,3,2015-06-04,review,2

My brother who has good taste (except in women) booked the Priory Hotel as a safe haven for family members not in town for a celebration. Alone the first day, I ended up in conversations with two smart fellows: Adam, bartending at the jewel box Monk's Bar and Max, master of the front desk. At their suggestion, I took myself for a walk realizing, crossing the 9th St. Sister's Bridge, 'downtown' was closer than my local Whole Foods. So is the new stadium! It was beautiful later that Saturday evening, light rain drops on my face, looking up at the suspension bridge as I crossed the river again on to safe, well-marked sidewalks, having spontaneously bought an available ticket to an A+ traveling Broadway musical in the breathtaking Benedum Theater. (That's Pittsburgh!)
I opened the front door to my fully stocked, 2-storey, 2BR, 3BA, private townhouse to find 6 red roses on the dining table and a note - a gift from those fellows who witnessed my grief and hoping to cheer me, left a coupon for a glass of wine and a reminder to return under happier circumstances. How 'bout That.  Plus, the linens are cotton, the mattress was superior, the parking is free, the coffee, made in the right proportion was delicious and the continental breakfast served fresh fruit, local bagels, and real butter!

It is a total dive of a bar.  It's fairly small inside and no one seemed to pay us any attention.  Key West seems like the type of bar where you get regulars and so if you've never been there before, you're probably going to stick out.

CHw1HVGJE0fDY_-5keDKGw,sssCE-e5lPObc9aqe5bjow,"So apparently I have this habit, at least last week, of visiting a bar/restaurant during its most dead time. In this case, it was somewhat understandable for Clark Bar & Grill because it was a very uneventful sports week. Regardless, I wanted to check out this place, housed in the old manufacturing warehouse of the historic Clark Bar Candy Co. (RIP) just north of PNC Park.

I wasn't overly impressed with either the menu or beer selections. In fact, there were only five beers on tap and one had just kicked. I ordered the special, a Reuben sandwich with tater tots, which were both decent. I washed it down with a Penn Pilsner (local brew) and then left to go check out another place on the North Side.

This may be a good spot to hit up before/after a Pirates or Steelers game because of its proximity to both stadiums, but I'm not sure I'd venture back otherwise.",2,k1A8pNspBPinGDivxkuDSA,2,3,2012-07-16,review,2

So I walked over here and for $5 the allowed me to use the restroom for the rest of the day (they stamped my hand).  I was told that it would be donated to a charity (I believe he said ALS).  Great idea if it is true.  The restroom is not very large (men's room had 2 urinals and 2 toilets) but it is much better than the options out in the parking lot.  

As far as the rest of the place, it was packed with fans prior to game time.  Lots of food, drinks and tv.  Might be a better hang out spot if the weather is crummy. But I prefer to tailgate.  It'd be a good spot to watch the game if you did not have a ticket and tailgated with your friends.",1,k1A8pNspBPinGDivxkuDSA,1,3,2012-09-20,review,0

2Az24juAhTJtmlqr5UWXSQ,AedrVIB-PcXbNIutnaMEQw,"Got tickets to the ZoSo concert at Stage AE and decided to switch up my pre-lube location from something other than the Tilted Kilt, River Towne or Bettis Grill. I decided on the Clark Bar.  

I've only been to the Clark Bar once before for lunch about three years ago. I remember being impressed with the Boomer Burger and even tweeted the following about it: ""Just had a Boomer Burger at the Clark Bar for #lunch. Half pound of deliciousness discovered on the N. Shore of #pgh"" (the accompanying pic that I took that day is uploaded here). So I came back to drink a few beers and have some dinner with my lady before the show. 

Speaking of beers, there's a limited selection of craft beers here.  As of this writing, on tap they've got Penn Marzen, Dogfish Head 60 min and Sam Adams Cold Snap.  In bottles there's Bells Two Hearted IPA and Sierra Nevada Pale Ale (they also listed Blue Moon and IC Light as craft beers but I'm sorry, I don't think so).

I walked in the door at around 5:30 and I noticed that it wasn't too crowded; possibly due to the weather.  There were four guys at the bar and a couple of tables were occupied but nothing like I've experienced at the establishments on the other side of the parking lot.

While waiting for my date to join me, I started with a Sam Adam's Cold Snap as a tribute to the day's February, single digit, temps before moving on to the Marzen. Both were decent beers, very drinkable, but nothing all that special.

It was pushing close to 7:00 when we decided to order dinner. By that time we were the only people left in the bar.  We asked the bartender about the crowd they get and if this is normal for a Friday night.  He said that lunchtime is normally their busiest time and he gets a few regulars that work in the building after 5:00 for a bite and a few drinks. Other than those times, it's before and after the ball games that draws the most business (as you would expect).

The menu is pretty simple offering a few appetizers, salads, burgers, sandwiches and the ""House Specialty"" Fish and Chips.  There were also specials listed on a chalk board at the entrance announcing drink specials, wings and a Cajun burger.  I decided I would go Cajun tonight. My girlfriend settled on a turkey burger. 

My Cajun burger was spicy good delicious; perfectly grilled with a slice of pepper jack cheese and hot pepper rings balanced with a tomato slice and lettuce. I also got a sample slice of my lady's turkey burger (yeah, we do that) and it was juicy goodness as well topped with cheddar cheese, onion, lettuce and tomato. Her burger came with slaw and mine with fries.

Overall this is a casual, easy bar.  They obviously recognize their Pittsburgh roots and being nestled between the two stadiums they cater to the Pittsburgh sports fan.  Photos of past local sports teams and legends adorn the walls in a relatively tasteful manner. But what's really cool is all of the autographed baseballs, bats and footballs in the hallway behind the bar.

I'd recommend this place to any out-of-towner or anyone going to see a ball game or show on the North Shore. I give it a solid 4 stars for ambiance, service and delicious burgers. If the beer selection was better I would have up it to five stars.",0,k1A8pNspBPinGDivxkuDSA,0,4,2015-02-15,review,0

So we entered, the waitress made eye contact and did not say ""seat yourself"" or anything.  That was really just awkward.  A few minutes latter we just sat down.

Thankfully a fellow irishman who I assume owns the place saw that we had sat down and directed a waitress to take our order and he seemed to have to remind her to take care of our stuff.  I don't think they would have bothered otherwise so thats the -1 star. Maybe that's normal. Maybe its because they had a large group.

However, since we were taken care of the food came out quickly. Let me tell you it is worth it.  The food is cheap, hot good and plenty of it.  I mean this is the best breakfast I have had locally.

I got the ""big breakfast"" option.  Awesome.  Hot cakes, eggs, sausage all done just right.

This isn't the bar and grill located near PNC Park; it's a little diner that stands alone on a corner as you drive past the Warhol and continue towards the David McCullough Bridge. It's easy to miss or just drive on by, which is kind of a shame because this is a pretty nice spot to eat, I think. It can admittedly be a little offputting to walk in if you're not expecting their seating arrangement, which consists of a mix of booths, regular tables and fold-up tables (along with chairs that you're more likely to find in a school than a diner). 

But food wise, this is definitely the place to go for cheap, greasy diner eats. They make breakfast as well as lunch, and I have to say their breakfasts look pretty good (three egg omelets with a side dish? Holy crap!). I've mostly ordered their sandwiches and burgers and thought they were pretty good overall. As long as you come in expecting diner food and nothing else, I think you'll like what you find!

A note - this place charges a fee for using a credit/debit card when you spend under $10, and their food is so cheap that you can spend less than $10 very easily. So bring cash!",0,e5DtayybW4jbKcDBwEUmOQ,0,3,2014-10-12,review,1

tAKjY3bQXH51msJbOHYPmQ,9RderOMftSXkhTvlyo3LfQ,"For the last two years that I've lived in my house in Bellevue, and did my weekly shopping trip to the Strip, I have driven past this intersection before the 16th Street Bridge and saw the sign 'diner' pointing to a totally unassuming little building beyond the gravel lot to the right. I often thought that I'd like to try it 'maybe', but with my experiences with local diners, I've kind of been put off from even walking in the door, only to discover price gouging for lousy food. Most local 'diners' are either pretentious grease pits that yokels stand in line to drool over (Deluca's and Pamela's come to mind) or they've cut costs, portions, quality and raised prices and are really not much more than low-level Denny's or Ihops (Ritter's?)

But, by luck this morning, my friend and I decided...hungry...try!

Ok 'foodies', bow your heads in shame...because all I can say about this diner is...

THIS is what a diner is SUPPOSED to be!!! THIS is what this older UN-'trendy' classic guy remembers as a true DINER! 

It is a very small hole in the wall, with a totally unimpressive 'atmosphere'. No kitsch, no sentimentalism for the old world diner. No phony nostalgia. It's a collection of tables and chairs, a small counter, and a kitchen window, with one TV on one wall. No frills.

Our waitress, Courtney was right there for us, and as friendly and 'diner' as could be. Pulled up a chair and sat right down with us to take our order. Coffee (which was actually pretty good. No foame-latte-latte-mocha-chino...it was black coffee in a solid white coffee mug. With a good dose of coffee in the coffee. Not water dressed in brown, but a nice smack of coffee)

The menu had a pretty decent variety of typical breakfast and lunch deals, combos, platters, eggs, pancakes, meats, etc. I chose the breakfast burger...1/2 lb ground beef patty, with bacon, egg, cheese, lettuce and tomato, and according to the menu, served on French Toast. The French Toast did not appeal to me so I asked Courtney if I could get it on a regular bun. She looked at me and frowned and shook her head sternly with a 'NO'. I gulped. Then she smiled and said 'Of course, I don't like it with the French Toast either!'

My friend ordered French Toast AS French Toast, with a side of sausage links and some hash browns. My burger was to come with chips, but I decided hash browns sounded better. Check.

The burger arrived and was actually ground beef formed into a patty, and NOT the Sysco truck frozen hockey puck patty. SCORE! They cooked it mostly to order (not as pink as I would like, but it did ooze juices when bitten into - SCORE again!) The hash browns were NOT frozen and out of a bag, but I could tell they were all real potato freshly shredded. SCORE again!

My friend's French Toast was very nice sized bread (not Texas toast, but not Wonderbread either), and were beautifully golden with a touch of brown. And when he bit into his sausage links he let out a rather orgasmic moan of goodness. He liked the hash browns, as did I, but I would ask for a little extra crispy next time. 

Courtney kept our coffee topped off, was attentive without being a hounding drone, and very friendly. 

So, while people are standing in lines just across one bridge for mediocrity with a bigger price tag, we both got a VERY filling and beautifully made meal, around regular folk in a very comfortable spot with a much smaller price tag. And we didn't have a Marvel comic book with flappy ear holes and a Ferdinand the bull nose ring serving up our food! SCORE again!

AND...we had no wait. BIG breakfasts for two, which we upgraded, with two very nice cups of Joe, $25.04. 

So...you stand in line at Pamela's for...what exactly?

For those who like breakfast before or during your trip to the Strip, I highly recommend avoiding the hipsters and wandering zombie suburbanites, by ducking into Mullin's instead.

They have everything from smaller hard rolls, sourdough and salt sticks, baguettes, larger loaves of pretty much every kind of bread you can think of. They even have featured breads daily, such as raisin walnut and cheddar focaccia. And the best part is, it's CHEAP!! Crazy cheap!

D4UtG6k4Y_T7_xsvj8zDkw,AzJmvHHbBXhwZ9E-uZ_MiA,"Vietnamese people LOVE french baguettes. It has something to do with French occupation resulting in my older relatives knowing how to speak French and eating my curry with bread. (Grammar-wise, why are all my relatives eating my curry? I refuse to fix the previous sentence.)

I went on a journey through Pittsburgh in search of a good baguette. Of course, being a student, my first destinations were Giant Eagle, Whole Foods, and Trader Joes. After I finished sobbing with swollen gums, curled up at the bottom of my bathtub, I was determined to not give up. Then I found the outdoor bread stand at Strip District, Allegro, and BreadWorks Bakery. All three make fantastic bread and specialize in their own things, but the award for best baguette goes to BreadWorks Bakery. For now... DUN DUN DUN.

So of course, with every bakery, there is the option of buying and eating right away. But there is also the option for half-baked baguettes at BreadWorks, where the bread is not fully finished and you finish the rest of the baking yourself. Now, if you hear yourself saying, ""Why would I do the rest of the job for them?"" I don't want to be your friend. Who would not want freshly baked bread at home? Ugh, who are you? Anyways, I buy a bag of those, put it in my freezer, then finish it off in the oven whenever I need my baguette fix. (Seriously, I love this bread. My girlfriend is worried about my waistline).

So what makes a good baguette? It has to be crunchy and thin on the outside, but delicate, light, and soft on the inside. You don't fight the bread when you eat it (and it shouldn't win, for that matter... your poor gums after sub-par bread); instead, it should break and tear easily. The bread here has those qualities.

The rest of the breads are good. There are tons of varieties. The mini rolls are adorable. And I LOVE BREAD.

I love coming here for fresh bread--the only down side is that I feed two people, and most of the loaves that they sell are for at least four people, so I end up eating at least two servings of bread with dinner.  Can't fault them for that, though...

They have french loaves, breadsticks, specialty focaccias...and I am just addicted to their  salt sticks.  SO GOOD!

They are cash only, but you don't need much, because I have never spent more than $5 here.  (Yes, you read that correctly.  The bread is AMAZING and at least half off from what you'd pay in the strip for the same loaf.)

I have never actually been inside BreadWorks, but tons of Pittsburgh restaurants use their bread.  So finally, my parents stopped in with a 50% off coupon last weekend to try some different things.  And since I am poor thanks to graduate school, they shared.

First, we tried an assortment of rolls. If you are a fan on Max's Allegheny Tavern, this is where they order their rolls from!  My personal favorite was the pumpernickel raisin roll.  

However, the real winner of this trip was the pepperoni and cheese focaccia style bread they picked up. It was served in a pizza box, and probably about 8 to 10 inches in diameter. This bread was amazing. It was packed with pepperoni and amazing cheese.  Then, there was baked cheese all over the top layer of the bread.  It was one of the most delicious things I have ever eaten. I savored every last bite.

My parents walked out with all of this for under $4 so it would normally be around $8.  What a steal!  I just wish BreadWorks was a bit more convenient to my house, but it is so good that I am willing to travel!",8,Z7HNl4Gz00cA0_wt0S-vSw,6,5,2015-11-04,review,9

Today I ordered an ""antipasta"" (sic) salad that came with wilted lettuce, thinly sliced, low quality deli meat, rotting carrots, and an overabundance of some shredded white cheese. The entire combination filled slightly more than one quarter of the styrofoam container it came in.

On multiple occasions in the past, I have ordered hoagies from Ron's. While I have had enjoyable hoagies from Ron's, that is not the standard experience. The hoagies are very inconsistent in terms of quality, occasionally good, frequently bad. If you get a hoagie, I don't recommend one with produce on it. The produce in their hoagies is as bad as their salads.

I won't be ordering from Ron's again, despite the inexpensive menu. I'm all for a cheap meal, but only if a certain standard of quality is met. With Ron's, you are better off considering fast food.",0,CqHTknOJHZZncWzGtpbNsA,0,1,2012-07-17,review,1

The Pizza was well put together and cooked right, wings are hot and also cooked well. I have had the Italian hoagy 2 times and both times the meat was plentiful and the veggies fresh. I don't agree with the other reviewer that it was all that cheap, but maybe the increase in cost is reflected in the better quality of the food.

DLu1Bum8EXNE62xno-v0VA,DPTBiFWpftpZzYMM9fBHQQ,"I ordered lunch from Ron's Pizza Palace after a staff member of theirs visited my work's building to promote Ron's to nearby businesses. The staff member gave us all a menu and mentioned a discount we could use for the day, so my coworkers and I figured we'd give them a try. And...I was pretty underwhelmed. 

For starters, a couple people definitely had problems ordering due to a poor connection or something like that. Fine. It happens. But then when our food eventually arrived the poor deliveryman told me that he had no idea how much my lunch cost. Fortunately, I'd gotten that info when I ordered. But what in the world did he plan on doing if I hadn't calculated my payment in advance? Would I have had to call in to sort out their staff's mistake? Would I have just handed the guy a random amount of money and waved him off? I have no idea.

And the food itself certainly left a lot to be desired. I had ordered mozzarella sticks as an appetizer, but they did not impress me. The cheese was anything but gooey, and I ended up eating a couple sticks in one bite because the cheese simply wouldn't rip apart when I bit into it. The batter on the sticks also left a pretty bad aftertaste in my mouth, so much so that I chugged Coke after every bite to try to make up for it. 

As for the sandwiches, my coworkers complained that their hoagies all came with too much mayo - one girl had even asked for her mayo to come on the side. No such luck: it came on her sandwich just like everyone else. As for me, the ranch I had asked to go with my buffalo chicken hoagie didn't even arrive. I used some from the company fridge. And the ranch was the only way I could eat the sandwich, which was drowning in buffalo sauce and could have been taken out of their toaster a lot sooner - entire sections of my sandwich's bread shouldn't break off when I bite into it, but that's what happens when you over toast something so badly...and is what happened here.

I currently don't plan on ordering from this place again. This is a prime example of ""you get what you pay for"" - and personally I'd prefer to spend a couple extra dollars for a tastier and more satisfying lunch.",0,CqHTknOJHZZncWzGtpbNsA,0,2,2015-09-23,review,1

They serve proper Bavarian food - Wurst, Bacon (?), Red Cabbage, fried potatoes - pretty solid. You can also get omelettes together with a Krug of German beer. Is that what we Germans do for breakfast back home? Maybe in the Bavarian woods, I'm not sure, but it is definitely something.

The interior is quite unique - imagine Oktoberfest in 1935 and you get the idea. Fun fact: not everyone in there speaks German and they have waitresses that work there for over a decade.

BX4_7BEWwtCI764bvYw2bg,iExqVbS94LOh8WeUmmHLmA,"How to put this gently?

While I may go back to Pittsburgh some day, I will never return to the Carnegie Museum of Art. 

It's not that I mind that its gallery seemed small compared to others I have viewed (sometimes small museums have some hidden treasures) or that one whole gallery was blown glass and I felt like I was at a bong shop on haight st. in sf. 

It comes down to the fact that a docent, while trying to explain a painting with a watchtower in it, told the students it was a watchtower ""from Auschwitz, a place where they basically fried a lot of Jews"".  Seriously? That's how she chose to describe concentration camps to a large class of what I could only guess were middle schoolers? It sounded like she described a bad breakfast joint...""oh that place? they basically just fry eggs"".

On top of all that, the description of the piece stated the watchtower was reminiscent of those that were spread throughout East and West Germany during Hitler's rule (i.e. not those in Auschwitz).

In sum, docents are a reflection of the institution in which they volunteer, and this one sucked. So, Carnegie Museums of Pittsburgh, if you're going to hire racist people to lead your tours, at least make sure they have their facts straight (or can read).",0,EEuGTah-oEssSl3o6pK-ZQ,1,1,2007-05-23,review,0

In addition, the art museum, although nice, did not live up to the ""major impressionist collection"" rep it has. Maybe I'm just spoiled with Philly museums, but this one was a bit of a disappointment.

When I moved to Pittsburgh, they had this sort of omnibus exhibit of their own permanent collection called (somewhat inappropriately) Panopticon and arranged kind of Barnes Collection style. That was cool. But on subsequent visits, the permanent galleries were equally impressive and even more pleasurable in their everyday arrangements. 

I might be mistaken, but I think that even everyday the paintings are hung above one another, not all in a straight line in a white box of a room, ala the Metropolitan's modern collection. 

I also think the furniture collection is pretty exciting and the Teenie Harris Collection and Project is fascinating. 

I will say, though, that in six years I was never once moved to go to any of the special exhibitions they hosted. 

I guess it's important to note, too, that the art and natural history museums are attached to one another (and located in Oakland), and one admission covers both. The fossilized dinosaur skeletons at the natural history museum are supposed to be amazing, but I OD-ed on dinosaurs somewhere around the second grade.

When I was visiting the Carnegie Museums this summer, they were hosting the Life On Mars international art exhibition. They showcased a very interesting array of international artists that were on the cutting edge.

wNtyBJa_qaRYUew_TWplgw,wVLvNJHpmlrZ-m8jnh-cGQ,"The pros: Dinosaurs in Their Time is pretty cool.  The years of renovation were worth it - the former dinosaur hall is completely transformed.  Remember how everything was in straight lines and the dinosaurs were up on their big pedestals?  Now the exhibit is sort of S-shaped, the walls are painted with colorful murals, the support columns are disguised as trees, there are plants around the dinosaurs and dead leaves underneath.  Underneath every dinosaur is a nameplate with a lot of information and a touchscreen with even MORE information, including a section on how the Carnegie Museum researchers contributed to the discovery or naming of this dinosaur.  There is a lot more natural light than I remember, and there are 2 balconies that overlook the exhibits for more photo opportunities.  There is also an extensive timeline of the Carnegie Museum's expeditions and contributions to paleontology, and a timelapse video of the renovations.

The cons: The rest of the history museum is pretty lame compared to this new and awesome exhibit.  The biggest examples are the 2nd floor Halls of African and North American Wildlife and the 3rd floor Birds hall.  Big cases of taxidermy in a wood-paneled room with dim lighting - hardly thrilling.  The 3rd floor Polar World is starting to look dated too.  Even the fonts used date the exhibits.

Admission is now $15 for adults, $11 for students (free for Pitt students!).  This does get you into the Carnegie Museum of Art also, but I'm usually tired after doing the whole history museum so I never get over to the art side.  I would recommend seeing the dinosaurs, then skipping the rest of the history museum if you've been there before.

To say that the Carnegie is THE Pittsburgh Cultural Institution is indeed an understatement and as I live in nearby Squirrel Hill, I am so happy to have it within walking distance.  Although the day I visited, I rode my bike and parked it all day.  (Note to Yelp'er Mike O. from Park Ridge, IL--I didn't wipe out this time!).

I decided to spend the entire day at the Carnegie, and believe me it was worth it!  As Emily H. says, the Dinosaurs in their time was really worth it!  It went from being a stuffy, dull, ""stuffed and mounted"" exhibit to being a really neat walk-through one.  The murals really give the exhibit a sense of time and place.  The exhibit shows how the plants, mammals, fish, and insects that surrounded them continue to evolve and create the biological diversity that surrounds us today.

A long-time favorite of mine is the Hillman Hall of Minerals and Gems.  I've always loved the bright colors of the gems and could stand there for hours in hushed awe of these beautiful stones.  The museum just added the Wertz Gallery of Gems and Jewelry to the Hillman Hall.  The gallery has an extensive collection of birthstones, giving the history of each and how birthstones came to be.  The current special exhibit is the watches and timepieces from H.J. Heinz, including a stunning music box and watch piece.

But as much as I enjoy natural science, I really love art.  The Carnegie Museum of Art includes  American art from the late nineteenth century, French Impressionist and Post-Impressionist paintings, and European and American decorative arts.   The Heinz Architectural is dedicated to the collection, study, and exhibition of architectural drawings and models.  I particularly enjoy Asian art and the Carnegie has an extensive collection of Japanese prints.  

One special exhibit that I really recommend will be there only until October 18, 2008 and it is ""Abstract Art before 1950: Watercolors, Drawings, Prints, and Photographs"".  It consists of avant-garde works by European, American, and Japanese artists.  

So while the admission fee is $15.00, it does include both the Natural History Museum and the Museum of Art.  To get your money's worth, plan on staying a whole day.  I did and I still feel like I didn't see everything.",4,EEuGTah-oEssSl3o6pK-ZQ,2,5,2008-10-16,review,8

This three building complex (the Museum of Art, Natural Science and History, and the Carnegie Library) sit on an entire city block, lined with sculptures of winged sirens, dinosaurs and literary legends.  Complimented by the lush Oakland landscape, right on the backdrop of the University of Pittsburgh and Carnegie Mellon University, the locale delivers wonderful exhibitions across most mediums and provide a wonderful cultural and learning experience.   

I recently visited the museum to see ""Horse,"" an exhibition in the history museum, depicting how this working animal has influenced human culture.  A VERY interesting and educational exhibit.  With one of the largest dinosaur collections in the world, you could literally spend an entire day in the History museum alone.   

Over at the Art Museum (which joins through one hallway) The Scaiffe Galleries house works of Rodin, Monet, Klimt, Hopper and many others.  There's something there for everyone - paintings, etchings and sculpture.  And, don't miss the Hall of Art and Architecture.  This enourmous room houses casts of early Greek and Roman buildings, as well as church and mission facades' which cannot be matched.  

If you're in town for the Carnegie International, you're extra lucky.  As one of the largest annual art shows, the museum hand picks pieces from around the world, showcasing leading contemporary artists.  A must see.  

There is a cafe inside the museum, as well as a couple of gift shops. There are also several restaurants on Craig Street, adjacent to the museum.  There is paid parking next door to the Art museum.

The galleries don't have the most intuitive layout, and I kept feeling like I was missing something as I walked through the smallish rooms.  Still, it was pretty easy to find the collections that most interested me.  The photography exhibit has some fantastic portraits and slices of Pittsburgh history.

The natural history museum, on the other hand, was full of kids of all ages running around among the dinosaur skeletons.  I spent less time wandering the exhibits of gemstones and preserved animals than I had spent with the art, but still recommend checking out the badass dioramas of North American and African wildlife.

I noticed that in a few of the displays, cards indicated that a certain number of artifacts were supposed to be on display, but some had been removed with no explanation or updating to the information.  Or maybe someone stole them and the museum hasn't noticed yet!!

In terms of natural history museums, I think we have been spoiled for all others by the Field Museum in Chicago.

The Natural History Museum is a dinosaur lover heaven. The fossils are seriously awesome, especially the one that you see when you walk in (that is still in the huge rock face.)  Just a great collection and definitely a good place for families.

The art museum has some great items in it - the Monet probably stands out for most people.

The layout of the permanent collection is one of the most logical and easily flowing I've ever seen.  And the collections, while not huge, are all solid.  Definitely the 'right' pieces for someone who wants a nice overview of a period of time.  

We were already tired by the time we got through the second floor (we never did go down to one) collection and decided we had to at least check out the dinosaurs.  

Awesome.

""that backpack looks too heavy for you! come down with me and check it in a locker."" yeah right lady...it was baffling to me why they would insist on this as a huge deal, so i asked someone ""in charge"" later (while i was being rule-abiding one shoulder museum goer) and she explained that ""people that wear their backpacks correctly forget that theyre wearing them, and turn around abruptly and knock over things or people""!!!

Prior to that, she was Ambassador to the U.N.  While serving under President Bill Clinton, first as U.S ambassador to the United Nations, and then as Secretary of State, Albright became known for wearing brooches that purposefully conveyed her views about the situation at hand.  She was famous for saying, ""While President George H.W. Bush had been known for saying 'Read my lips,' I began urging colleagues and reporters to 'Read my pins.'""

In 1994, Saddam Hussein's government-controlled press referred to then-U.S. Ambassador to the UN Albright as an ""unparalleled serpent."" She then wore a golden snake brooch to her next meeting on Iraq,  

I was really quite enthralled by the collection that Secretary Albright cultivated.  As my guide says, ""The collection is distinctive and democratic-sometimes demure and understated, sometimes outlandish and outspoken-spanning more than a century of jewelry design and including fascinating pieces from across the globe.""   Some of the pieces on display were fine antiques, such as the circa 1880 ""Blue Bird"".   But many of the pieces were costume jewelry.  

I guess my favorite piece was ""Liberty Brooch"".  Now this piece, circa 1997 by Gijs Bakker, is the head of Lady Liberty with two watch faces for eyes, one of which is upside down-allowing both her and her visitor to see when it is time for an appointment to end.  A very clever piece, and judging by the others' comments at the exhibit, I'm not the only one with that opinion.  Mom really loved it too.  

So this was a really powerful exhibit of an eclectic collection of jewelry.  I strongly recommend reading the accompanying book, ""Read My Pins: Stories from a Diplomat's Jewel Box"", which you can get at Barnes & Noble or Amazon.  Madeleine Albright is an inspiration to women in politics and government.",2,EEuGTah-oEssSl3o6pK-ZQ,2,5,2012-03-13,review,2

I mean, really I had only stopped in for something to do on a rainy day out in Pittsburgh for work ( I mean after work was done I swear). So I stopped in to see what the museums were all about, and I was more than surprised to see the magnitude of serious works they have, the diversity of their collection, oh and dinosaurs. Two museums for the price of one really is a bargain, there's no way to not see that. The collections in BOTH museums are interesting and vast.

Different people have different ways of experiencing museums, personally I like to meander and find different things at different times. I was glad to see that I could definitely get lost here in different ways on different occasions. But no review about art and dinosaurs (natural history) is really going to cover everything the space has to offer, so I'll just say that you won't be disappointed, and who knows maybe you'll really love it.

Since we have a family membership (which I highly recommend), we typically pop in for an hour or two at a time, focusing on different areas of the complex in Oakland every time we go. Our daughter seems to enjoy the dinosaurs the most, but she's also intrigued by the art collection! My favorite part is the Hall of Architecture, filled with many incredible casts of facades and sculptures. Just the fact that they have casts of the Venus de Milo and Nike of Samothrace is unbelieveable - I don't think that casting of these timeless works of art is even allowed anymore. Don't miss out on the basement kid's room, because it's full of hands-on activities for the young ones.

HI7byNVBtzinyLl3UCvynA,7nJeDamjKHzW_KJToDiNJw,"Not many people can say they have wedding photos with Jane, the Tyrannosaurus Rex at the Carnegie Museum, but our family can! This museum was not only a huge part of my daughters' childhoods with at least 1 visit every summer, our youngest daughter got married there. The Carnegie Museum will hold a special place in our hearts forever! 

The basic exhibits have been there since I did my school field trips (a loooong time ago!) and there have always been special rotating ones to check out and enjoy over the years. What one doesn't stop long enough to realize as you're schlepping kids from place to place is the amazing architecture of the building itself. That's what became so apparent as the wedding was taking place. The murals all around the walls and ceiling of the grand staircase area where the ceremony was held are spectacular, as well as the marble columns and staircases themselves. I had never had the opportunity to stand there and take it all in until that moment and it's pretty mind blowing how gorgeous everything truly is. 

The 2 typical places for social events at the museum are The Hall of Architecture, where our reception was held, or the Carnegie Music Hall. Both are amazing event sites. Parkhurst Dining does the catering for events at the museum. Yes, it's the catering division of Eat N Park which initially gave us pause until we did their tasting and from that point on we had no worries. They produced really spectacular food elevated far above what one considers typical banquet fare. Everyone raved about their steaks being perfectly cooked and everything arrived hot to the tables. Alice, the baker, did a phenomenal job on the wedding cake, too. I'm not even a cake person and have to say that Alice's chocolate cake with raspberries was killer! 

All the Greek and Roman Facades in the Hall of Architecture had always given me goose bumps when I walked in there over the years. Imagine it decorated for a reception! Truly unique and wonderful. 

The Carnegie Museum is certainly a Pittsburgh treasure to be enjoyed on many levels both as kids and adults. And based on our experience, it's an unbelievably great place to host an event.",1,EEuGTah-oEssSl3o6pK-ZQ,0,5,2013-08-22,review,1

Dear Warren Buffett, don't mess with my ketchup!

FACT: Heinz Ketchup is used in 93% of restaurants, nation wide!

The HJ Heinz company was formed in 1869 when Henry John Heinz sold his mother's canned horseradish door to door. 

Today Heinz's headquarters are still here in Pittsburgh, although no products are made in Pittsburgh anymore. The plant at the base of Troy Hill near the Allegheny river was sold to Treehouse Foods where they make private label soups. I'll never forget going to the factory as a Cub Scout and how the vinegar smelled as we toured the factory. We each got a full size bottle of Ketchup to take home with us, and of course a Pickle Pin, one of the most iconic symbols associated with Heinz.

Again, Mr Buffett, don't mess with the red stuff or a whole gaggle of Terrible Towel waving Yinzers will open a can of whoop ass on ya!",4,49nxzKLr2qQnLF58qo2p1w,3,5,2013-02-15,review,2

That being said the friends I was with also didn't seem overly impressed by the food, so I think I'm being generous and the rating should be more like 2.5.

I ordered the spinach ravioli and they were just ok.  There was way too much sauce and I guess I anticipated it to taste a bit more basily or something - it did say basil cream sauce, but what I got just seemed like a whole lotta tomato vodka sauce.  The spinach and ricotta didn't have much flavor, but perhaps that was due to my diminished lack of taste these few days with being sick.  All I could taste was the tomato sauce and that to me does not make a great or particularly good meal.

When a meal rocks my world, I usually want to lick the bowl clean, yes, like a dog.  I did not, sadly, feel that way about this place.  It IS BYOB but the catch is it's $4 PER glass.  Yep, that's right, not per table my friend.  Keep that in mind.

I got the greens and beans on recommendation from many Yelpers on here.  Maybe I just don't have the taste for it, but I thought it was weird, watery and....not good.  I also thought it was going to be green beans and it was kidney beans and spinach that tasted like a warm Caesar salad.  No thanks....

I ordered the Penne Vodka, which is my fav meal to order at Italian restaurants.  I also like to add a meatball on if it's homemade.  It was, in fact, confirmed to be homemade so I was all over it!  The meatball itself was delicious.  I love a bread-y meatball.  You know the type.  Soft and packed with flavor.  It was the winner of the night.  The vodka sauce was good, but I wanted way more.  Now I have to preface this by saying I'm a total sauce-aholic.  I love me a good amount of sauce, this didn't even come close.  Then I looked over at Serena R's plate, and her ravioli (which I thought was the same) was SWIMMING in it!  So I stole some of hers....

Would I come back?  If someone really wanted to.  But I have a hunch there's way better Italian places to dine at in the Burgh...so now I'm on the hunt!  I gotta connect with my roots, ya' know?",2,q_BKmbdlYfQJroJVHfYMUQ,2,3,2011-12-21,review,11

After walking in, Legends North Star is small but homey which was nice. The place was not filled so we had our pick of tables. Our waitresses were sweet and did not kick us out after we remained at our table to finish wine 30 minutes after closing. 

Legends North Shore provides bread to munch on. Crunchy airy pieces that don't fill you up entirely before the entree which I so often do and they provide a bottle with seasoned olive oil (which was kind of oily on the outside). I tried the Tuesday 99 cent green and beans special along with a salad and spaghetti and meatballs. I wasn't sure what the green and beans were but they were cheesy and salty but very watery. I thought they were tasty but confused if what I ate were indeed what greens and beans were suppose to be. The salad was fresh but nothing special, and I felt the same for the spaghetti and meatballs (made in house from the meatball to the pasta). I feel that when you go to an Italian restaurant you can judge how well they cook based on classic dishes. I couldn't stop eating the spaghetti and meatballs though I felt full half way through. I thought the meal was overall good though not anything spectacular and pricey for what it was - ~$18 ($17 for spaghetti and meatballs and $.99 for the greens and beans plus some tax). Maybe if they knocked a few bucks off to $13 or $14 or so it would be more reasonable imho. Also points are deducted for the corkage fee of $4 per person, not per bottle. We were not aware so they basically made an easy $16 bucks from the four of us at dinner.",0,q_BKmbdlYfQJroJVHfYMUQ,0,3,2011-12-23,review,2

So one of friends and fellow yelper lives in the hood so we decided to bundle-up, wine-up on a snowy friday night and head for Legends. The interior was more retro than I was expecting, not extremely cozy.  The menu is pretty standard with some rotating specials.  I decided on the chicken cacciatore.  Big portion. No pasta. Potato and veggies. I was stuffed!!

Besides BYOBs, I also have a weakness for restaurants that are walkable. Check.

PROS: BYOB, Friendly servers, open kitchen, large menu for a small place, WALKABLE. 

CONS: Lame Corkage fees, could use an interior face lift.

Pros:
-Great, friendly service. Morgan was my server and she was super fantastic. Quick, efficient, sweet. She offered up helpful suggestions and even let me try a sample of the soup of the day before I placed my order.
-Homemade focaccia: Mmmm rosemary! Tasty and free slivers of love to go with your meal. 
-Portions: Mammoth. From the bowls of soup to the pastas to the pies...sharing is caring.
-Spinach ravioli: My main dish of choice. Flavorful spinach and cheese pillows of pasta cooked al dente and smothered with tomato basil sauce with a touch of cream. Damn good pasta, my friends.

Cons:
-Menu items price out a few dollars higher than similar Italian joints. But, the value is here, though, because of the increased portions. 
-Restaurant set up/ambiance: Is a bit odd. It's kinda like a diner...with bare tables...and carpet...and a few random pictures on the wall.

This restaurant is in a prime location on the North Side and has plenty of opportunity to capitalize on the growth in the area. That said, allow me to jump into some of the minuses:

Beans and Greens appetizer - I love beans and greens, but was shocked by the amount of garlic the chef added. Actually, I don't think it was garlic...I believe it was garlic salt (a huge no-no) Don't get me wrong, I love garlic, but there was so much that it killed a simple, rustic dish.

Blackened Shrimp Pasta - My date and I shared this dish. This dish tasted as though an entire container of garlic salt had accidentally been dropped onto the plate before being served. The shrimp and pasta, however, were cooked well. Had the chef backed off the garlic he would have presented a more edible dinner. i was not in the mood to send this dish back to the kitchen, but did call this out to the waitress once our meal concluded.

The restaurant is cute, in a great location, and service is friendly and prompt. These are all important things to me, but quality and taste takes precedence.  Unfortunately, Legends just didn't do it for me.

Would I go back? Most likely not. There are far too many other Italian restaurants in Pittsburgh that I would like to give a try.",1,q_BKmbdlYfQJroJVHfYMUQ,2,2,2012-10-18,review,3

For appetizers we ordered the margherita bruschetta (best choice), fried polenta, and greens 'n beans (mainly because we went on a Tuesday when they had a special deal for 99 cents with any entree). The focaccia bread is great with the homemade mixture of olive oil and herbs. 

I ordered the mussels bianca over linguine--terrific. Also comes with shrimp. The portions are generous but delicious, in part because it's clear that the tomato sauces are all made fresh and in-house. I tried my coworkers gnocchi--good, but I was quite satisfied with my own dish.

We started with the polenta and the mozzarella.  The mozzarella was unremarkable, deep friend mozzarella in breading.  Of course it was good, it is fried cheese!  But it was nothing special.  The polenta was a real stand out, tasted home made and was delicious.

They give you garlic olive oil and garlic bread sticks to dip in the oil.  This was free so I'm not complaining, but that just seemed a heavy and oily combo to me.  Also, the breadsticks were covered in rosemary, and I loathe rosemary.

My friend had the special, pan seared shrip over pesto penne, and she loved it.  I had this chicken dish with apricots and it was ... alright.  It was good but I felt like the searing on the chicken could have made this dish excellent.

Well that wasn't the greeting I was expecting and was surprised at this question since the place was empty but within a half hour I totally understood why.

This small but quaint restaurant filled up very fast.  This establishment is just lovely and was clean and was decorated for the holiday season.  It was cozy.   The menu was small but had something for everyone and the prices weren't too bad but It might be a little pricey if you are on a budget but it's worth it trust me.   

The service was excellent.. we received beverages and bread within a moments time.  Our bread basket never remained empty either. 
We ordered the ""beans and greens"" as an appetizer and it was delicious. My Italian Mother makes this dish all the time and it was ""almost"" as good as hers - which is saying a lot.  
  
I had penne pasta with sausage, roasted red peppers, olives and artichokes.   It was very tasty but was a bit salty for my taste (think it was the olives) but still delicious.

Fresh greens and was accompanied by carrots, red onions, feta, cherry tomatoes and olives.   By the time we were ready to leave there wasn't an empty table in the place.

I had made 7 PM reservations for us and we arrived shortly before that to a table that was ready for us.  The inside of the restaurant is actually much tinier than I had expected with as many people crammed in as possible.  It probably was helped that the night we were there, there was a party of 10+ next to us.  They would also order just before us understandably leading to some slower service times for us which I would guess is not the norm.  Other than it being crowded there was not much else in the dining room to look, just some table and chairs as well as some pictures on the walls.

For dinner my girlfriend and I decided to start of the evening with the polenta to share.  It came out cut into pieces and served with some sweet sausage and a pesto drizzle.  I thought that the sweet sausage was the best part of it with the polenta being ok while my girlfriend really enjoyed the polenta.  For our dinner entrees I ordered the Penne Vodka which came with a tomato basil cream sauce and prosciutto while my girlfriend went with the Penne Parma that had some artichoke hearts, roasted red peppers, olives and sweet sausage in a garlic wine sauce.  Both pastas also came with salads before the meal and both my girlfriend and I ordered the house balsamic dressing.  The salads came topped with many different things and I thought that they were pretty good salads for being included in the meal.  The Penne Vodka that I ordered ended up being really good!  It was delivered when still at a fairly hot temperature and I really enjoyed the sauce.  It's only peculiar item was that the prosciutto was almost off to the side and not in the pasta which I found to be odd but I still enjoyed it.  Even though I really enjoyed my pasta, I actually thought that my girlfriends meal tasted better.  The garlic wine sauce on hers was awesome and made each bite of her entrée that I had a treat.

We both ordered specials. They were different preparations of fish. Both were really good. Everything we tasted was wonderful. 
The downfall was when we got the check. The specials were both $30+. They were good - but not that good! You can find great Italian food elsewhere and skip the $100 tab.",0,q_BKmbdlYfQJroJVHfYMUQ,0,3,2013-04-08,review,0

It came with homemade Italian wedding soup, which was good with fresh veggies.  It also came with delicious bread and seasoned oil for dipping-- excellent!  The eggplant was good, but honestly, the sun dried tomato and olive tapenade did not enhance the sandwich. It would have rocked with a homemade marinara instead.  
The waitress was friendly in a casual way, and the atmosphere was warm and contemporary.  I will try something else next time, as it is worth a return visit!",0,q_BKmbdlYfQJroJVHfYMUQ,0,3,2013-04-17,review,0

HI7byNVBtzinyLl3UCvynA,XrrT6PWfbt0vonzKqhMVmw,"We have been wanting to try Legends of the North Shore for a long time and since we were right across the street yesterday, we seized the lunch opportunity. It was not what I expected at all. Tiny I expected because I'd seen it driving by many times. Diner-esque inside, completely unexpected. I knew they are BYOB but after eating lunch here, I can't imagine any scenario where I'd take more than a couple of beers with me. Not a place to linger over a bottle of wine. Tables on top of each other, cramped and kind of a low end divey diner, uh uh.

I wanted the mussels for lunch but was told they were out of them. Not terribly disappointed because our server had just run through the lunch specials and one had caught my attention enough that I mentally considered changing my mind anyway. A fried zucchini plank sandwich with melted mozzarella and side of sauce. I do love a good zucchini plank and had never heard of anyone creating a sandwich out of them, so no hardship to change my order. 

That was a greasy, good lunch sandwich....heavy on the greasy but, I've always loved some tasty 'fried deliciousness!'

Hubs had the sausage sandwich... good...but mine was the clear winner.
Starter soups were homemade and tasty. Hubby had black bean and I had the chicken pastine, aka wedding soup. The broth rivaled my premium homemade Christmas chicken soup broth so no complaints on that. 

Overall: ambiance 1star, mine and hubby's sandwiches 3 stars, soup 4 stars. Average is a 3 - not rushing back but I'd clearly have lunch there again, if I'm across the street.",3,q_BKmbdlYfQJroJVHfYMUQ,0,3,2013-07-04,review,2
qaMsP2zsLnelcd4Hj60TmA,1luOD2wRMLzPL22doDp_6w,"I'm pretty much committed to trying EVERY BYOB restaurant around so this was on my list for a long time. Friends told me it wasn't worth it but I persisted to the point that we went there for lunch yesterday. My first reaction was not a pleasant one. The cheap plastic chairs, the small close together tables, the tacky decorations, not a good feel but I pressed on. 

Now, I didn't avail myself of the BYOB (might have resulted in a higher rating!!) and it was only lunch so I can't comment on dinner. Regrettably, I won't ever try them for dinner so this is the best I can offer.  I think Legends in their name only applies to the sports heroes and not any legendary food experience you'll find here. 

The place is essentially a diner. Diner atmosphere, diner chairs, diner specials, diner everything. Not that I don't appreciate diners, I do. But this atmosphere is BLAH.  I'd rate it a max of 2 stars. Max. 

Food on the other hand is ok. Not great. Ok. Worth going out of your way for? Absolutely not. I had the Parma hot sausage with a bowl of black bean soup- both things I love!!! We're these memorable? Not in the least. It's generous to say they were adequate. ""Mama's gravy"", a marinara sauce of sorts, was lackluster and flavorless. The sausage was just a split link of hot sausage and something I could replicate at home with ease. The black bean soup was listless and uninspired. Sad because i was expecting (hoping?) for so much more.  I wish I had ordered the chicken parm that the guys pressing up against me from behind ordered. It looked way better. But I'll not have that chance cause I won't be going back. I'll drive by this place a thousand times to go to other more deserving places on the Northside. 

Sorry. Didn't do it for me.  Can't even imagine coming here for dinner with a bottle of wine. Would be awful.  I wanted to give it 2 stars but felt a little generous today. Plus, I thought if I worked down the block, I'd probably come here for lunch. But never would I go out of my way to go here.",3,q_BKmbdlYfQJroJVHfYMUQ,1,3,2013-07-04,review,5

Upon entering Legends, you get the immediate ""hole in the wall"" vibe (a vibe that I love) with diner style tables and chairs. 

We started with the margarita bruschetta. This was delicious increasing my already high expectations. Our waitress came back- I ordered the Penne Vodka and was excited, but overwhelmingly disappointed. The sauce, although good, is simply ordinary. I've been to countless Italian restaurants in Pittsburgh and could name at least 20 better than Legends.  

Had Legends not received substantial praise I may have not been so disappointed, but when you're touted as one of the best I expect nothing short. To their benefit the restaurant is BYOB, maybe this gets so much praise because everyone's drunk before their meal is served...

We ordered an app and unfortunately this is where our problems began. They brought mussels instead of our mozzarella sticks. But this was quickly corrected. 

They were fair. We had the Brussel sprouts which were under cooked and did not have any Parmesan cheese on them. Plus they were mixed in with large random pieces of lettuce. So odd!

The food: 
I tried a house special dish of the day - It was a blackened flank steak over penne with peppers, sun-dried tomatoes in a gorgonzola cream sauce. The dish was excellent, the right combination of sweet, salty, and savory, and the steak was on point. It came with a house salad that was a delicious blend of fresh greens with olives, peppers, tomatoes, the like. It also included grilled bread with a bottle of olive oil and Parmesan cheese for dipping. 
My boyfriend ordered the Veal Parm, it also tasted great, but it was nothing outstanding. 
Tuesday is there ""Greens and Beans"" for 99 cents special, so we also gave that a whirl. It was decent, lacked some flavor, but I wouldn't order it again. 
The Staff: 
Service was excellent, our waitress was attentive and answered all of our dumb questions. You can also see the cooks making the good, all around they seemed pleasant. 
The Ambience:
We were not aware this was an ""upscale"" Italian restaurant; from the vibe, the name, and the decor, you'd think standard Pittsburgh food. True to the name ""Legends"" the walls were lined with your staple Pittsburgh sports news clippings. The whole place was tiny, so the tables and chairs followed suit. I would by no means have minded the ambience of the food matched the theme- but it was a $20 average plate place, and I would have appreciated the vibe to match. They also placed terribly loud, out-of-date pop hits I could have lived without. Even silence would be better. 

All around, the food was great, not excellent, but overpriced for the setting and ambience. I would recommend and I may go again. Also, be weary - it's BYOB with a $4/person corking fee.",0,q_BKmbdlYfQJroJVHfYMUQ,0,4,2016-03-16,review,0

_SdxQp5EAWL2CEGb6kNNAw,Dy4_drDXCM1LW7vrT3YhBg,"Update:  Chef Dan read my review (below) and was kind enough to refund the meal. As stated in my original review I should have sent the meal back right away, so that part is on me. Great quality customer service. 

When I go which is probably about a half-dozen times a year for the past several years.  I usually just order the Beans and Greens.  This past Friday evening I did something different, I ordered the special which sounded divine.  Blackened ahi tuna with two different kinds of ravioli asparagus and mushrooms topped with artichoke hearts covered with a cream sauce.  Well when the dish arrived I thought it was my dinner companion's meal because all I saw at first was the ravioli.  My friend was confused as well because she thought the fish, the tuna was replaced with salmon, was an unripe tomato.  It was in fact the smallest piece of salmon I had ever been served in a restaurant barring a piece of salmon sushi.  My friend joked that maybe because I was wearing a kimono jacket they thought I want a bonsai salmon.  Now I blame myself for not sending it back, this is what I should have done.

XNHYOiR2t2zw3TMhYjruQQ,0kdk5hiwbbb-hyb3c17OrQ,"The best thing about this place is Sam. The worst thing about this place is also Sam.

What was great was that Sam made me feel at home and treated me like someone he had known for a long time. He took me to the back of his warehouse, gave me a free beer to drink, and engaged me in plenty of conversation. At one point, though, he said, ""You look oriental, but you also look American."" I'm pretty sure he wasn't meaning for it to be offensive, and I just discounted it as his being an old man who didn't know it was no longer politically correct to say things like that.

This is not why I recommend against Caruso's, however. The reason why I'll never go there again is because Sam knowingly sold me expired beer.

I was on my way back from the North Side to the East End where I live and after seeing these good reviews, I decided to stop by. I wanted a case of Yuengling, but Sam said, ""Why don't you try this instead,"" and popped open a fresh bottle of Castello, an Italian beer. He had me drink it, all the while espousing its comparative taste to Yuengling at a cheaper price point. It certainly tasted alright, and a case of it was a couple dollars less than what Yuengling was going for.

Since the Castello tasted fine, I ended up buying a case of it on Sam's recommendation. A few days later when I opened the box and drank a couple of the beers, however, I noticed that they tasted funny. That's when I looked at the label and saw how each of the bottles had its ""sell by"" date marked out in black Sharpie. You could see the numbers underneath the Sharpie, and the dates were for well over two years ago. So basically, Sam had convinced me to buy something he hadn't been able to sell, knowing that I lived in the East End and probably wasn't going to visit again anyway.

Stale beer aside, there's another big reason not to go to Caruso's: Their prices are steep--$24 for a case of Yuengling. While Sam might be a more charming character than the young folks at my neighborhood distributor Pistella's, at least I know that Pistella's has significantly lower prices and actually has enough customers and product turnover that they won't purposely sell me something that's not fresh.",1,zq--BGVHu7_fb1VHEwg2ow,0,1,2013-10-15,review,1

I live nearby and have shopped here multiple times a week for the past year or so.  I find this store to be consistently clean and the employees to be helpful, polite, and efficient.  Despite being much smaller than most Giant Eagle stores, this one offers a decent selection of international foods, organic products, and vegetarian/vegan items.  I regularly buy produce here and see no difference between the quality/freshness of what this store offers and what other Giant Eagle stores sell.  The main difference in the produce section is, truly, the lack of dim, directional lighting that new and newly renovated stores use to give their produce that false garden-fresh glow.  Harsh overhead lighting doesn't create much of a mood, but at least I can see clearly enough to choose the freshest items.

As for all the remarks about this store's clientele...wow.  It's amazing how people in the politically-correct 21st century manage to find new ways to express 19th-century bigotry.

The pharmacy inside the store, unlike the store itself, is corporate owned, and it's staff is friendly and efficient. A stark contrast to the rest of the store.

Once again reflecting the relatively low income of the area this store serves, there will be one of more jitney's (unlicensed cabs, effectively) waiting outside the store willing to take you and your groceries home for a small fee. 

In general, if you CAN shop somewhere else, you will probably want to.",0,cZl7-Um4HiJWFgDVmMan2Q,0,2,2014-12-18,review,1

I took 5 or 6 pairs.....3 I can still wear, 2 I can't even button them up. I knew something different happened. They shrunk so terribly that I felt it only right to ask them to reimburse me for the jeans.
The owner Mr. Pfennig, gets on the phone when I called and said......whatever.....excuse me while I scream...... I work in a department that saves customers from leaving because of financial issues, service issues and reps who are rude to customers that have been with us for less than the 6 years I was a customer at this cleaners. If I said whatever to a customer more than likely it would get escalated, customer would disconnect service or with the new guidelines.....fired I would be.

It gets better......I walk over to the cleaners to speak to them and show them the work they did and was further insulted by Me. Pfennig when he said well my wife doesn't remember you and you brought these in on the 4th of January...it's the new year maybe your body changed. If I was 18 I would have beat his ass over that. Like who goes from 38's to 42's in 7 days? I even showed him the same size jeans that were done correctly and he still would not visually acknowledge that the cleaners shrunk my clothes! I told him that 2 pics, a hashtag and Twitter would fix this. 
It's a new day and age and for someone who supports small business to be treated and talked to this way is no longer acceptable.
The sad part of this was I would have continued being a customer if he had reimbursed me $90 for 2 pair of 501's that I purchased on sale from Macy's. 
I see the one thing that stands out in these reviews is the owners lack of customer service skills. I will never give them another penny and the money I spend going elsewhere will be worth it.

Trish, the bartender, is a fantastic bartender with a hilariously sharp tongue.

I haven't tried very many of the menu items, except for the chicken wings, which are a house specialty.  Everyone recommends the Four-Dip sauce, which is pretty good.  The Cajun rub is good too.

But I thought ok it's just $3 so it's not like I'd be going broke.  The music was fairly loud which made it difficult to talk and no one was dancing.  It wasn't overly crowded which made it easy to get drinks.

The bar area is narrow and cramped then to the left of it there is a dark area where the DJ is along with some tables and then the stairs to the bathroom. If you weren't at the bar then people were just sitting at the tables starring at the DJ or at you... Maybe one or two people were dancing to the music. I thought the music was awesome though - a mix of old school and underground hip hop. Beers were so cheap - I think we paid $5 for three draft beers. Woot!!

SVd6Re9tpabo413b4LghYw,-swBR1Rtuzg9YATzGDnd7A,"I haven't been a member of the Allegheny YMCA for very long, but I've had a great experience so far.

The building itself is on the older side -- I'd guess it's probably about 100 years old.  The equipment, however, is pretty modern, and many of the rooms have been retrofitted for modern gym conveniences such as air conditioning.  

The Allegheny YMCA has the following features:
1) A room with cardio machines (some traditional elliptical trainers, some of the newer breed of elliptical trainers that are like a mating between a stair-stepper and an elliptical, rowing machines, and exercise bikes).  Most of the cardio machines are only about a year old and have those weird little TVs mounted on top, so you can see Barack Obama's mouth silently moving as you get your workout.
2) A basketball court with a track on top of it (28 laps = 1 mile).
3) A spinning studio.
4) A pretty decent weightlifting room, with a good balance between weight machines and free weights.  There's also a good range of free weights, so a weakling like me and a strong man like the dude I saw with biceps bigger than my waist can both use the weight room.
5) A pool that is not Olympic size, but is big enough to get in a decent workout by swimming lengths.
6) Secure access to the women's locker room (as well as to the fancy men's locker room).
7) A group exercise room.  Group exercise classes are included in the membership fee, and the instructors are really nice and also inspiring/motivating.  There's a good range of classes for all ages and fitness levels, including Pilates, yoga, water aerobics, spinning, and cardio kickboxing.

The membership fees are pretty reasonable here (a family membership for 2 adults and 2 children is $58/month plus a $125 joining fee), and if you are employed by UPMC, you get an additional discount.

Most importantly, the Allegheny YMCA is a very welcoming place, regardless of your age, gender, or current fitness level.  Gyms can be intimidating if you aren't in the greatest shape to begin with, and some gyms have members who aren't kind towards women who aren't super-fit or super-skinny.  But at the Allegheny Y, everyone I have met has been extremely friendly and nice to me, which is the best incentive to keep going to the gym.",0,Hm61vENWRqcAL_v6E3dD9Q,0,5,2009-01-20,review,1

The cardio room is still really, really good.  I've never had to wait for a machine, and the machines are quite nice and new still.  

The weightlifting room is also totally adequate, with pretty much a full complement of machines (older, but still serviceable), and a good assortment of free weights and related paraphernalia, including a Smith machine and a regular good ol' power cage.  There isn't any platform for Olympic lifts, and I haven't seen anyone in here perform them (there isn't a lot of room, so I'm not really sure how one would even go about powerlifting safely in this gym.)  However, there is a bucket of chalk in one corner.  Go figure.

The pool is fine if you aren't really hardcore into swimming.  If swimming is a major form of exercise for you, however, it might not be the best pool for your needs.  It's a four-lane pool, I think 25 yards long.  It is heavily chlorinated, and it tends to be QUITE warm, especially on Monday mornings (this is because kids with sickle-cell anemia use the pool on Sundays, and the water needs to be especially warm for them -- it hasn't cooled down yet by Monday.)

I had the parmesan crusted chicken with pasta, which seemed to be coated in the same breading they used on the zucchini, still too heavy and altogether flavorless.

We've been 3 times over the past few years, each time we say ""let's try it again"" followed by ""wish we'd done something else"".

Reminds me of the movie line ""Run away, run very far away""

Last nite after Steelers/Jets was last straw. I hope the owner or general manager reads this. And think the health department should too.

Service is mediocre and slow. consistently. Waitress was ok in attitude.

After our soup starter (good french onion soup) we waited and waited and waited and waited for our mains. Noticing us staring at her, waitress stopped by, went into kitchen, came back and said we were next. my watch said 8:31. Then her manager came by and argued with me and said we were next, then at 8:52pm the horrible food finally arrived. That's 21 minutes to be next. In that time we watched 4 tables turn from being seated to drinks to mains to check down while we waited for our main. 

Manager embarrassed himself. Said they were busy and working our food and he had checked and would come soon. I told him about the 4 tables turning and he said no they didn't. then I said I used to manage restaurants and know what customer service and ticket times are and he challenged me and said no I didn;t and I had no idea what I was talking about. What an idiot! First rule of restaurant business is the customer is always right.

Then the food arrived. How hard is it to do chicken marsala with mushrooms, seriously? It was two soggy fried chicken tenders from the deep fryer (not pan sauteed) over a bowl of bowtie pasta with shrooms and a sauce. While the sauce did have some marsala in it, it was full of sour cream and tasted like stroganoff and a little funny. The Penne ala vodka was sauteed canned tomatoes and no flavor. We were so hungry we ate most and left.

Now, let's talk about when we reserved a room for a bridal shower...  We had a fixed menu for a group of about 50 ladies.  I understand that.  But when the bride asks for no tomatoes, you as a server do not say, ""No substitutions!"" in your meanest voice.  Lighten up, it's her day.  I ended up just taking the tomatoes off for her--and just chalked it up to another maid of honor duty.  The server also kept clearing the bride's drinks while she mingled.  This was annoying, but at least we had paid a flat fee for drinks, so it wasn't the hugest deal.

Overall, the server for the bride's table was just awful and kept treating us like little children.  Yes, the table was the bridal party and the bride's cousins.  Yes, we are all under 30.  But we are also young professionals and the ones who booked the event.  The servers who waited on the rest of the tables containing the mothers, aunts, great aunts, and grandmothers were polite...even when my near-senile grandmother started yelling about bandits.  Later, another server apologized on behalf of our bad server and mumbled that, ""he just must be on his period.""

sS2sSWqZMnQMRoWx-Mdzgg,7eN85uYB3-Eb23jm4_CrYw,"Having lived near this Atria's location in the past, I can say that I've spent more than my fair share of time at the PNC Park Atria's. My wife and I stopped in this past week, and for me, I was reminded of why I enjoy Atria's...but this having been our first time at Atria's together, and witnessing my wife's experience, I realized why the place could garner such low reviews.

For someone like myself, who's actually had enough positive and negative food experiences at Atria's to know exactly what to order and what to steer clear of, I can make the experience a positive one, but that's a situation I'm afforded now thanks to my previous patience and convenience. My wife, opting to stray from my suggestions had an awful dinner. Her plate of bland fish and asparagus left her turned off completely. Luckily, we were using a gift card, so it wasn't as frustrating for her as it could've been. Regardless, walking away from an entire plate of food is disheartening.

That led me to realize this: If you're only at Atria's once, you're odds aren't that great of having a good experience. That's just the reality of the situation. There are a handful of really good things on the menu that I LOVE. The parmesan crusted chicken is really good, although it can sometimes be a little too oily. The pot roast is excellent, but it's way too heavy for most of the year...ESPECIALLY during baseball season when they're busier. Their chili is really on-point...especially paired with their bread, and the salmon salad is excellent. Although, I don't like the salmon, so I swap the salmon for chicken for a great salad option. The carrot cake is insanely good, but truth be told, it's not homemade. I could care less, though, as it's still some of the best carrot cake I've ever eaten. Period. Other notable items are the pot roast nachos, crab cakes, red skin smashed potatoes, and the reuben.

That's really where the positives end, though. I've learned to steer clear of the burgers because of the inconsistency with which they're prepared. I've received more undercooked burgers at Atria's than any other restaurant, and it's just not worth the gamble anymore. My filets have always been perfectly-prepared, but the one time I got a strip it was practically burned on one side and undercooked on the other. Failing to cook burgers and steaks correctly isn't that surprising, but deciding to serve them to customers despite their incorrect preparation IS surprising...and poor.

I know that the last time I had salmon on my salad, the fish tasted ""off"" and I paid the price for it later. I've never given a single fish meal a chance there since (we're talking years now). Hence, my request for chicken on my salads now. Most of the meals that I've had are average, and I've practically tried the entirety of the menu over the years, so believe me when I say it.

Why do I continue to go? Well, because the few items that I do love, are crave-worthy, and having become a regular (less so, nowadays), the service that I received at the bar was always excellent. Daniel and Roy have always provided  great service to me, and good service goes the distance, as far I'm concerned, so it's been worth stopping in from time-to-time. Unfortunately, if I can't sit at the bar, I don't always stick around, as the service at the tables is really hit-or-miss. For every good server they have, they have two more that could care less about their jobs...especially during peak times.

Regardless, this is my favorite Atria's location, because it's the least ""stuffy"" and pretentious location of them all, but there's still a lot of room to improve...and I hope it does.",1,Z101WZaISochG6g7tI2ZVw,1,3,2012-03-26,review,1

We were seated pretty quickly and they have options for indoor and outdoor dining. It was opening day and quite crowded but our server did a nice job. I started off with a Corona. My big disappointment was they had a special game day menu and it was very limited with not many options.  I went with the cobb salad and it was very good-fresh veggies and a nice portion size.

p9OvcIakpDoDXl0Lez5CJQ,802vdriSDUaW4nlq81OIvw,"ok, i don't want to judge all atria's by this one. in fact, i wouldn't even judge this atria's solely by this one experience. but let me tell you, i was highly disappointed.
i will point out the good parts of the night first. we arrived to see a band play. the entertainment was great, didn't cost extra (although there was a $20 minimum per person), and i liked the set up in the room where they played. also, the soup i got (crab bisque) was delicious!
ok, now, for the rest of the experience. first of all, our service was AWFUL. i don't know our server's name, and i know some of the wait wasn't his fault, as there was a large party upstairs. but it took at least ten minutes to even order our drinks, another 15 before we even got them. ten more minutes before we could order our food, and after the meal, we must have waited at least 15 if not 20 minutes for our check before one of the members in our party finally had to go up to our waiter and complain. i saw him checking on other tables, and it didn't seem like he had many tables to keep him so busy. as a server, myself, i always give my servers the benefit of the doubt, but it really got to be too much. the one thing i will say for him though, was that he was very nice. but for how much we waited, we should have had something comped or at least got some sort of apology BEFORE we had to complain.
the rest of the food and drinks were okay. good, but not enough to make up for the service. i had the berry mojito to drink and the greek salad to eat.
i'd try another atria's before i'd go back to this one. but now i'm weary of the restaurant all together.",0,Z101WZaISochG6g7tI2ZVw,0,1,2014-05-19,review,0

Exceptional choices, good crusty bread and she's lovely and a Pittsburgh institution. 

Service was spotty. I was there representing my company. We produced the music that evening. I'm not sure if the server assumed that we wouldn't be ordering food or what, but after we ordered the cheese course and wine, he came back only to attempt to take away our menus not to take our order.

It had outdoor seating and was right outside of PNC Park. We decided on the Pot Roast nachos as an appetizer. It was pretty good. Nice chunks of Pot Roast and various cheeses. I than decided on the Atria combo which had andouille sausage, Perogies, Chicken and Sauerkraut. I figured that this would be something different. The sausage was great and so were the perogies. I did not care for the chicken too much. It was dark meat with bread crumbs. I prefer white meat so that was probably the reason. I also tasted my friends steak  hoagie. I am from the area so I have had better. It was a little dry and not enough cheese and onions. The outdoors ambiance was great! Pittsburgh has a great downtown. Nothing like Detroit.

gtJJBaQwTwE45NnNF0coVA,7R1exAyphC-HAYsBWC5Mbw,"Visited for the MCG Holiday Jazz event and this place exceeded my expectations on all levels -- food, service, ambience, and entertainment.

Food:  We ordered a small cheese platter.  The chef actually came out and explained the cheeses on our plate.  Nice touch, though I have to admit to not necessarily knowing which cheese went with which explanation.  Nonetheless, all were quite tasty and better than I would have imagined a simple cheese platter would be.  

I ordered fish tacos which were quite tasty and my husband ordered the pork tenderloin, the Novemberfest special, which was also tasty from the bite I acquired from him, as were the squash bites I ""stole"".  

Service:  Greeted immediately upon arrival and ushered to our table right away, despite being very early for our reservations.  Offered drinks as soon as we arrived at our table and our server was always there when needed but not pushy when we weren't in need.

Ambience:  We sat in the small dining area next to the bar and near the stage.  Cozy, quaint, warm feel to it.  Nice venue to hear the jazz band while still being able to carry on a quiet conversation.

Entertainment:  I've been trying to like jazz for awhile now and not all that successfully.  Last night was a winner for jazz band quality and for the vocalist's quality.  Very nice, indeed.",0,Z101WZaISochG6g7tI2ZVw,0,5,2014-11-25,review,0

I was meeting a few friends, so I decided to walk across the street and grab a beer and make a reservation (using open table) for 45 minutes later.  Reservation confirmed, and beer finished, I walk back over, walk in to the place and someone's at the computer in the entryway on the phone. He finishes, we make eye contact, he nods and walks away. My friends come in, we wait 10 minutes for someone who works there to talk to us. I tell her we have reservations, she acts like it can't happen, and that it's my mistake, she says that the place is closed for a private party. I ask why there isn't a sign on the door saying 'closed for private party', and I get a ridiculous answer that the ""CEO doesn't like us to do that"". How dumb is that: you leave your system open to make reservations and you don't alert people that might be going to a show on the north shore that the place is closed.

IqjFenVF7ofLICCug9DfgA,4UoAxvVdpzGivR497mEdgQ,"This is more of a 3.5 star rating. I visited this restaurant with a large group of about 40 people before going to a show at the New Hazlett Theater. We were seated upstairs and ate a buffet-style dinner (the dishes had already been picked). The two waiters who took care of us were extremely friendly and efficient, and they made sure we would leave in time for our show. While we waited for the food to come out, they served us drinks, but the waiter stopped offering straws after the first couple tables.

When the food came out, they let a few tables help themselves at a time. They provided us with three different types of plates (large square ones, rectangular ones, and small circular ones), which I found odd. We had three entrees in the buffet line: Chicken Marsala, Tomato Vodka pasta, and Parmesan Crusted Tilapia.

Chicken Marsala: flavorful, tender chicken served with mashed potatoes. I really enjoyed the potatoes because they had a distinct potato flavor, unlike most butter-heavy ones. However, I wish they were more generous with the tomatoes and mushrooms in the dish. There was no vegetable-based dish in our entire meal, and I missed them.

Tomato Vodka pasta: penne cooked with just a little bite left in a yummy tomato sauce with a couple leaves of spinach here and there. Again, I wished there was a lot more spinach in the dish. Also, the pasta was a little sauce-heavy.

Parmesan Crusted Tilapia: the fish was crispy and delicious, the angelhair pasta was cooked perfectly, and the tomato sauce was good. I grabbed some pasta near the edge that hadn't been touched by sauce, so I liked the amount. No vegetables, though.

Afterwards, they brought out a tray of bite-size desserts for us. I don't see any of them on their menu, so I'm not sure how the organization ordered them. Both the cheesecake flavors I tried (raspberry and almond) were delicious--the cheesecake was really light and airy, and the flavors really came through without being overly sweet or overpowering. They also had strawberry halves and chocolate chip cookies, which were soft and cakey--not the best I've ever had, but pretty good. Also, there were these little squares that, as far as I could tell, were squares of iced cake covered in chocolate. These were way too sweet for my taste. Mine looked like chocolate everything, but there were also white-chocolate covered squares, and other squares with different colors inside (different flavors of icing, perhaps?).

Overall, I enjoyed the food, but I'd like to try a greater variety before giving four full stars (and see if there are any vegetable-heavy ones). However, this restaurant is a little too expensive for me to return any time soon. The service was great.",0,Z101WZaISochG6g7tI2ZVw,0,3,2015-03-22,review,0

We were not brought or offered bread.  What brought down this rating was service problems which obviously were not the fault of our server.  I appreciated that the restaurant offered me a reservation when Open Table indicated that nothing was available on this day. The hostess did not seem to know how to handle a reservation and I do not believe that our arrival was matched to it. She asked another individual for assistance and I believe that person told her simply to seat us. After more than ten minutes had passed after we were seated without a server coming to the table, the hostess came over to ask if she could take a drink order.  She was not able to answer my question about whether the featured beers were draft or bottled.  Soon thereafter, our server, a charming and gracious young man, came to take the drink order.  We asked him to take our dinner order as well, given that this was stacking up to be a very lengthy meal.  More than fifteen minutes later, our entrees came, but no sign of my wife's wine and my beer.  I asked the young man who brought the food about our drinks and a few minutes later, our server came over, apologized, and told us how backed up the bar was.  He graciously told us that the drinks would be complimentary.  We received them more than five minutes after the arrival of our entrees.  These were not mixed drinks requiring anything special to dispense, simply beverages that had to be poured.  For almost the entire time we were there, a band was playing inside at a volume that was deafening.  We could not possibly have had our meal inside near the band as it would have been necessary to use sign language to converse and to order. We were seated outside as far away from the music as possible, yet it was still difficult to speak to each other over the din.  Additionally, the placement of the band in a small room makes it particularly difficult to snake in and out when coming in to use the restroom. The menu at this Atria's is a bit different from the traditional locations and some of the prices are not the same for items that are identical.

I, along with another friend, ordered the Bucco Louis' Grilled Chicken Sandwich with honey dijon, lettuce, tomato, swiss cheese, pineapple, and carmelized onions. (I left the pineapple off of mine).

Our waitress was extremely friendly and efficient. We told her that one of the members of our group was from Ohio...and obviously not a Pittsburgh sports fan.

We made the reservations ahead of time and the day before they called to say there was a race in front of the restaurant and we couldn't park out front. My 80-year old grandma was coming with us and she has trouble walking. The restaurant apologized but had no options for handicapped parking with the race going on. My dad parked in town and wheeled her in a wheelchair across the bridge. This worked out fine, but when we arrived at the restaurant they had us at a table upstairs. We asked them to show us to the elevator. They didn't have one. So after all the discussion the day before about handicapped parking why on earth would they seat us upstairs? We had to wait for a table to be set up downstairs. Luckily they were not busy.  We were seated near an outside door and had space for the wheelchair but by the time we were ready to leave they added a table outside in front of the door so we had quite a bit of trouble maneuvering the wheelchair to get out! 

We also had trouble with the food. My mom and sister don't eat gluten so they ordered a meal that had potatoes listed as the side dish. It came out of the kitchen with noodles instead of the potatoes. They said they changed the menu. But that should be explained by the waitstaff when someone orders the meal! We also waited over 15 minutes before someone even took our order. 

I did enjoy my own meal but all of the other trouble was not worth it. We won't be back to this location and especially not on a holiday when we expected to go all out for our mothers and treat them to an expensive meal without any issues about seating and such!",0,Z101WZaISochG6g7tI2ZVw,0,1,2016-07-05,review,2

Usually a ruben or the house salad with garlic vin. dressing and fries but recent construction near PNC Park has limited my trips. Well during this time Atria's must have made some major changes and not for the better. I decided to take the wife and kid to dinner b/c the day was nice and they do have outdoor seating. Unfortunately our waiter was not up to par. I sensed a little attitude when I asked if a particular dish was available but let his annoyed response slide. Atria's at PNC Park has a streamlined menu during Pirate game days. We then placed our order and shortly after I wanted to make a small change from the apps Sliders to the Kids menu sliders b/c they came with fries. Waiter then annoyingly rolled his eyes. I should have got up and left then but we were hungry and didnt want to go to another place for dinner. I asked if it was a problem and he stated they already started the order. Well, seems like a problem adding fries to a plate I guess....this interaction left me pretty angry and anyone who knows me would likely say I am pretty laid back. It is difficult to get under my skin. Onto the food. House salads for the wife and I which were pretty standard. I do love their garlic vinegar dressing. We also got a Chicken Ranch flat bread and this left us disappointed. In my pre construction visits this was one of the freshest, tastiest meals but I am not sure what they brought out yesterday. It reminded me of a Stouffer's french bread pizza. The sliders were fine but the fries seemed a lil cold considering it was the last thing ordered. All in all though I think my days at Atria's are done. At least the PNC Park location and that is sad since I was one of their biggest fans.",0,Z101WZaISochG6g7tI2ZVw,0,2,2016-07-08,review,1

We immediately talked to the people here and they told us not to worry- the same thing has happened before and the owner took care of it. So we think nothing of it (we were college kids and it was our first apartment).
A few months later we come home to find a 30 days notice on our front door. We were never informed by the landlord or the this real estate company that the house was under control of the city even though we were at the real estate office several times to pay rent and to check on the status of things. We had between paying rent that entire time that it was actually sold in the Sheriffs Auction. That is $600  month from August to March.
Of course, no matter how much we screamed and complained, we never got one cent back, nor did the downstairs neighbor. They probably knew we wouldn't have the money for a lawyer. Gotta love these companies that prey on people.

If you have kids and are in Pittsburgh, this is a great place to take them.  We have been to other city's children's museums and this is one of the best.

There are tons of stuff for them to do.  There is also a nice variety.  Something for everyone.  Even my wife and I were entertained.  The price of admission was well worth it considering movies are about $10 for only 1-2 hours.  We were there for at least 5 hrs and it didn't even feel like it.

The first major area you find is Mr Rogers Neighborhood, where you explore all the stuff from his ""home"" as well as the land of make believe, trolley and all.  There's a cool climbing thing that goes up two stories - not the typical Chuckee Cheese tube maze.  There are several interactive items that include taking your image and showing on the wall with other digital elements that you interact with.  Then you hit the garage.  We could easily have spent all day there.  For older kids, there is a workshop with a drillpress and other tools to build stuff with.  For everyone else, you can build cardboard stuff, then mess around with the innards of a Mini, climb up to a platform to launch parachutes, and much much more.  From there, go to the music room, then the circus room (I CAN walk with stilts - cool)  then upstairs to the water room (they WILL get wet) where raincoats and boots are provided.  Then go to the art room and make your own paper, silkscreens, paintings, printing, much more.  This is all we saw, and I know there is more.

There is this cool wall of steps that the kids can go into a climb pretty high if they want to. They have an art/craft area where you can do ink screen prints, make paper, paint and do other crafts. There are stations with everything you and your little ones need to make something cool. 
The second floor is perfect for babies and young toddlers or kids with disabilitites. It is basic with colors. blocks, books, soft play areas for babies, a box to play in filled with bird seed instead of sand. 
There are restrooms on every floor. 
The third floor is the most fun for my little man because it is all about water. They provide rain coats and little crocs. I just bring swim trunks and water shoes for my little one.

Have I gone down the twisted slide connected to the treehouse in a cocktail dress?  Yes I have!  Have I walked across the mini Pittsburgh bridge in the mini-Pittsburgh playroom?  Yes I have!  

Like any good museum, they constantly have changing exhibits, so things I saw are probably not there anymore.  But the interactive exhibits are all about participation.

If you live nearby, invest in a membership. If you're passing through, plan to spend all day and bring a change of clothes for the kiddos. They will get wet in the Waterplay area. 
With teeny tots, best visit time is during the week and we follow on facebook to avoid large group visitation days, etc. If you go in the afternoon, it feels like you have the place to yourself! 

Event calendar on the website is always up to date and a big help when planning a visit.
Have fun!",0,-Gfj1gA0Ir07zToO-4fBpw,0,5,2015-03-16,review,0

I was disappointed that their website boasts that it's for kids of all ages, and yet, my kids, ages 9, 11 and 13 were bored. Most all of the activities were physically set up for small children: water tables, art tables, as well as buttons, controls, etc were too low for my kids to enjoy without feeling like they were ""babyish"". If they are going to advertise for all ages, I feel they need to make sure they have things that interest every age, not just 2 to 6 year olds.  Also, I was disappointed that there were no signs explaining the science behind the exhibits. How could they say they do school field trips when there is no explanation of what is being learned?

But not only was the food great, the prices were very reasonable.  Every time I've been there we've gotten the specials on the menu (which usually include combinations of pizza, sandwiches, and drinks), and we've fed parties of 5-8 adults for under $20-$30.

Also, the service is great.  The two women that run the place couldn't have been more pleasant - and even compassionate when we mentioned the person in the hospital.

Be warned though, it's not in the greatest location.  E Ohio Street isn't the best neighborhood, and the place looks like a hole in the wall.

I have dined at the establishment and ordered take out several times.   Dining in can be real adventure because of the neighborhood Pickles is in.  One experience we had was fine, another we were approached for money twice on the way in and two additional people came into the restaurant asking for money.

My favorite menu item is the chicken fingers.  They come with fresh cut fries and cheese sauce.  I usually ask for blue cheese instead.  I've also had several sandwiches which were also tasty.  Nothing is out of this world memorable and worthy of adding stars, but nothing is objectionable either.  

If you order delivery, pay in advance with your credit or debit card.  The two times I've paid with cash, the delivery person claimed they didn't have change.   I had a $20 for a $7 order and was certainly not going to give that large a tip.

Recently my mother came up from out of state with my 11-yr-old nephew and she was excited to see if Pickles was still around so we stopped in.

Would I say Pickles is the BEST pizzeria in the Burgh? Well no. But for the highly affordable prices, the food is pretty exceptional. Between us our order spanned an XL pepperoni pizza, a personal cheese pizza, barbecue (6) and buffalo style (12) wings, cheese/bacon fries, and a half steak/cheese/mushroom hoagie (which was huge, light on the meat though) and only ran us about $40. I've ordered JUST a specialty pizza and wings from plenty of other Pittsburgh pizzerias and paid nearly as much! If you're looking for a tasty sammich or some awesome chicken wings, Pickles is definitely worth a try.

All that being said, I would recommend DELIVERY or PICK-UP and NOT DINING IN.

We ended up with two different servers (just to say, we didn't complain and didn't request a new one). The second server was just fine (too bad she didn't come around until the end!). Our primary server however, not so much. We had to wipe down our own table. We had to place our empty dishes and drinks on an unoccupied table as she never came to check on us or move anything out of the way. Our food was served sporadically, which was fine, but she never made any kind of note to us that anything we were still waiting on was on its way or that it wasn't forgotten about. She never came to check if we needed anything or if we were enjoying anything, only to bring more food, which she would hold until we took it from her. At one point my nephew had to use the bathroom (it's a tiny dining area and we had a clear line of sight all the way back so we were fine with him just going alone). I pointed to the back where I remembered it being, but as he was making his way there he passed our server and asked where it was so that he could be sure. We heard him ask clearly but she completely ignored him and literally all she had to do was turn around and point at a door that was a few feet away. Overall she just didn't seem very friendly or engaging, it was like the fact that we came in to give her our business was a nuisance. Add to that the fact that my mother (who was facing the window and could see all the sidewalk traffic) for about a good 30 minutes saw every other person on the sidewalk walking by with a ""classic"" brown bagged open alcohol container (to be fair I guess it was Happy Hour??), the dine-in scene was just not ideal.",1,Eixtf79t1_ZKaC-7J2kAWg,0,4,2015-07-08,review,1

From the food to the prices, you couldn't find better. Now that we live near North Side, it's been a constant struggle trying to find something that compares. I'm thinking we've struck out. 

We decided to give Pickles a go after receiving an ad in the mail. They had a pizza/hoagie/soda deal for less than $20. First of all, ordering was strange. The woman was friendly, but seemed like she was on a different planet. I ended the conversation telling her I wanted to make the payment with my card. She didn't understand. After going back and forth, she finally understood that I wanted to pay with plastic. ""Oh, you want to pay with a card?!"" Yes. Yes, I do. 

We usually pick-up (I hate waiting for cold pizza), but decided to get it delivered. One of those lazy nights. It took around 40 minutes which I would say is average. Wow... we're we disappointed. The pizza literally looked like DiGorno or some other frozen supermarket option. The crust was super doughy and the cheese was pretty gross. We ordered half sausage/half pepperoni. The sausage had a strange color, the kind of color you see on frozen pizza. I'm usually not a snob when it comes to pizza, but this was just not very good. The hoagie was decent-- a little too much mayo, but you really can't screw up bread and meat. I hate Pepsi and that was the only two-liter option they had available, so yeah, the Pepsi sucked.

The slow smoked spare ribs, sold by the plate size or full rack, are smoked just long enough to make the rib bones protrude from the top of the slab but not long enough so the meat is ""falling off the bone""... tender and juicy, but enough bite to let you know that you're eating the flesh off an animal.  The color and texture of the surface aren't overwhelming in flavor but give you just enough crust and seasoning to let you experience the strata of bark / meat / fat.  For those that don't like fat, you'll complain about the ribs.  Spares have a tendency to hold a bit more fat within the meat fibers, particularly the section around the tips that are usually trimmed for a St. Louis cut.  you want low fat? Eat a pork loin or a handful of grass.

The chickens are halved and smoked right alongside the ribs. The skin had nice chew, a good simple rub, and cooked beyond the point of any gummy texture but not so long that it was a layer of armor surrounding the meat.  The dark meat was succulent and the white meat maintained just the right amount of moisture.

As requested, everything was served with the hot BBQ sauce.  Not mind blowingly hot, but a well rounded picquant flavor with a bit of black pepper on the tip of the tongue.  Tomato base with a bit of vinegar, good enough to compliment the meat and fat of both animals.

As for sides, the collard greens are tender and you'll come across the occasional gold nugget of pork.  The coleslaw and macaroni salad are simple and a bit underseasoned, but when eaten in tandem with the meat and sauce they compliment everything just fine.  Mr. Wilson also caps off an order with the true stamp of great bbq... white bread. A vessel to mop up all the rib shrapnel swimming in the pool of sauce at the bottom of your styrofoam container.

It's not the cleanest, it's not the classiest... why?  It's a rib shack in an old house that's been here for going on 53 years.  It may not be the best barbecue you'll ever eat, but in a city with new restaurants popping up every week that all try to outduel each other with trendy ingredients, it's nice to know that I can walk in through an old screen door and be slapped in the face with a stiff breeze of smoking pork... without having to worry about anyone selling me small portion size, extravagant presentation, and a list of 35 ingredients to compose a single dish.",0,Z0OGW8PysysRXE0dR7QxQQ,1,3,2013-02-28,review,4

9OZH1Ecw-qUkCW5MS0NefA,2PP0eRDounnQskgwtGadrQ,"I stopped by yesterday at around 5:30 with CM to grab some dinner after spending the afternoon at the Aviary.  I'd wanted to try Wilson's last weekend before a visit to the Mattress Factory, but wasn't able to because we lacked cash, and Wilson's is a cash only establishment.  This time, we came prepared with plenty of green, so we were able to get our BBQ bliss on.

In case you don't notice the heady odor of smoked meat when approaching Wilson's, it literally hits you in the face as soon as you walk in.  I first inquired about the chicken, but was told by the gentleman working behind the counter (presumably Mr. Wilson) that they were out of it for the day.  Thus, CM and I decided to split a large plate of ribs (around $12), which comes with 6 bones.  Because we'd heard that Wilson's hot sauce is seriously hot, we ordered a mix of hot and mild sauce for the ribs.  For sides, we decided to order the collard greens and the potato salad ($1.34 each), and I got a can of iced tea, as well ($1).  Because he's still having some trouble breathing from his ongoing cold, CM requested that we get our items to go, so I obliged.

After finding a picnic table in West Park commons with a little help from a local resident, we unpacked the food and dug in.  We first tried the ribs, and found them appropriately smoky and the right texture, with sufficient give but not falling apart.  The sauce was just the right level of spiciness to satisfy both of us, as well--spicy enough to provide a nice kick, but not so spicy as to be overwhelming.  After finishing the ribs, we both used the slices of white bread provided to soak up the remaining sauce.  As for the sides, they were clearly homemade and of good quality and flavor, though the potato salad was a bit mushier than I'm accustomed to, and the collards were a bit saltier than I'd like.

Overall, we were quite pleased with the quality and amount of food that we received for the price that we paid (around $16).  Make no mistake: Wilson's is a hole in the wall, but in the best sense of the phrase--check it out for solid, unpretentious BBQ that hits the spot for a casual picnic lunch or dinner if you happen to be in the area.",13,Z0OGW8PysysRXE0dR7QxQQ,7,4,2015-03-15,review,19

I have screamed my head off at those ESPN analysts who constantly underrate (if they don't ignore) my black and gold (oh, and  by the way, did you know that Ben had a motorcycle accident, an emergency appendectomy, and a concussion last year? did you hear about that? didya?). I have thrown away one perfectly good Troy Polamalu jersey for fear it was cursed (and replaced it with an excellent number 43 throwback jersey). And, when I lived in San Francisco, I woke up for 10am games and had a beer in my hand before kickoff.

There is nothing, nothing in this world that could ever get me to root against the Steelers, or to believe anything other than the Steelers are the best football team in the history of professional American football.

The Pittsburgh Steelers have one of the best records in football history. They have won 5 out of 42 Super Bowls. Only 3 teams have won 5 and that is the Steelers, the Cowboys and the SF 49's. Seeing the Steelers are the only one of those three in the playoffs, they could break all records this year, by winning 6 Super Bowls. IF they go to the Super Bowl again this year, it will be their 7TH appearance.

IF, is the biggest word in the English language. If my grandmother had 4 wheels, she would be a box car. 

I was not thrilled when Bill Cowher left the Steelers, but I must say Mike Tomlin has done a fine job and we were blessed, to have had two great coaches. 

I have been an avid collector of autographed sports memorabilia for many, many years. I have quite a lot of autographed Steelers merchandise, including a football jersey signed by the Steel Curtain. 

I can't help but admire that more and more each week and think of how Mean Joe Green and LC Greenwood will be watching the games, with nerves of steel and how Ernie Holmes and Mad Dog Dwight White will be smiling down upon Big Ben, Willie Parker, Hines Ward, Troy Polamalu, Harrison, Holmes and the rest of the team. 

This week the Steelers have home field advantage of a ridiculous time of 6:30 against the Ravens. The Ravens play hard and rough and my fingers are crossed that we beat them for a third time this year. 

Everyone is thinking of how great it would be to have a PA. Super Bowl. I went to Heinz Field for the 2004 Eagles/Steelers game. I drove from Philadelphia along with Eagles Fans galore. We won and it was an awesome ride home.

bVnOZTk98o0TFTBfQVTYDA,4g2eLqVaDcKbmNaJmaGcgQ,"Coming from Holland I did not have a Football team, and I am not the type that jumps on any bandwagon that passes by. I needed a team that fits my personality, a team that 'clicks'. 

So I did some research and quickly certain teams dropped the list of potential favorites. Besides that I had to get used to the game in all it's aspects. It was a search that took over 4 years looking, checking and searching for that feeling that your team is suppose to give you when they play. That feeling of pain, anger and lost when your team leaves the field defeated, or the feeling of joy, full Ecstasy and invisibility when the team beats it's opponent. 

Well it happened in 2004 after almost 5 years of learning the game, researching the teams and most important falling in love with FOOTBALL. It happened in 2004 in Roethlisberger's Rookie Year, I realized the Steelers where a team after my heart. My favorite (43) Polamalu (USC Baby!), like a 'heat seeking missile' going after anything that's getting to close to putting a number on the board. Big Ben a QB that is not afraid to get hurt or hurt you when necessary. 
Willy Parker, always smiling Ward (even when it hurts), the Bus, Harrison (watch out now!), Santonio Holmes, Tomlin (Yes We Can) and all the others that made Steeler FOOTBALL part of my life. 

I did not only fall in love with the STEELERS as a team, but also the history of this great team was an important factor. I am still growing in knowledge concerning the game, and becoming more and more familiar with the past and present of the Steelers, but one thing I know for now and for the future; ""I AM A STEELER FAN!""

I want to thank my Mom and my Dad, for having me on the western side of the great state of Pennsylvania. I also want to thank them for being the best and least annoying people to watch football with.

I want to thank Mom specifically for giving me a general ADHD-proof explanation of what the hell is going on during a football game. I'd never be able to watch football if it weren't for her. I also want to thank her for freaking out and screaming the way I did when #92 intercepted the football and ran it 100 yards into the Pittsburgh end zone. I'd also like to thank her for not getting mad when I started jumping on her furniture when #10 made a game-winning catch with 2:4x left to go in the 4th. I also want to thank her for making Dad and me delicious chili and a Steelers cake so that we wouldn't get ill from all the excitement.

I want to thank Dad specifically for his love of the game and for explaining its intricacies to me [but only after Mom has had her say first.] I also want to thank Dad for laughing with Mom and I rather than at Mom and I. 

I want to thank the iron and steel workers who have made the three rivers region what it is and for inspiring the best football team in the NFL and for being its best fans. For once, the working class comes out ahead!

I want to thank #43 Troy Palomalu for intercepting and scoring at 40 yards, thus sealing a Steeler victory during the AFC Championship vs. the Ravens. http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IdlQ28cqgr8

CidOqoyJeeSzeVF7iJB_8Q,vBkMCKZXHCn4y8G_q5WAHw,"Steelers nation - let's debrief.
 
The Packers won. straight out.
The Steeler's secondary was continually compromised by Aaron Rodgers and their spread-receiving corps. In my estimation, there were only 4 offenses in the league that could have exposed the Steeler's 1st overall scoring defense this year - the Packers (obviously), the Saints, the Patriots, and the Eagles.
The Steeler's offense was plagued by poor quarterback play. As much as I had defended Ben as the best quarterback in the league for this team, his deficiencies created a deficit that proved to be insurmountable. He had faced some of the league's best defenses and had not given up 2 interceptions all season, which leads me to believe the Pack was the only team in the league capable of shutting down the Steeler's offense so effectively, even with key injuries to their secondary.
 
In retrospect, I think the Steelers should have pursued a trade for the first overall draft pick (aka Sam Bradford) for Ben Roethlisberger a bit more aggressively, although the draft picks we had kept by not doing so represent a lot of potential for upcoming years. I think it's very clear that the first priority for the Steelers in next year's draft is at cornerback (even with rookie Crezdon Butler's eventual return), and the secondary will need to improve significantly next year after being so exposed this year in order to be in playoff contention again. To this, I'd have to recommend for the second straight year that #22 William Gay be cut immediately, as he has continually shown that he can not answer the bell and play to the Steelers' standard.
 
All in all, it was a good year - with the loss of so many offensive linemen and Aaron Smith to injury, I wouldn't have expected more than a Wild Card berth and possibly a playoff win. 3 rookies had shown significant potential with 3 others being groomed for future stardom, while reacquiring veteran ex-Steelers had a nominal impact on the field (but whose locker room presence may have been more valuable). Getting to the super bowl this year was a bittersweet surprise, which will give the team valuable experience as veteran leaders may potentially leave after this season.",2,5GS5sBSscgcex0IFTDL9Bg,2,5,2011-02-06,review,2

Founded in 1933 by Arthur J. Rooney, they were known as the Pittsburgh Pirates, later, given their own identity and renamed the ""Steelers"" in honor of Pittsburgh's steel industry. 

The first thirty-nine years were not kind to Art Rooney and the city of Pittsburgh, the Steelers could never put a winning season together, until, finally in 1972 Chuck Noll guided the team to their first divisional crown and playoff victory. It was on December 31st that perhaps the greatest play in NFL history took place when the ""Immaculate Reception"" propelled the Steelers to a victory over the Oakland Raiders. Instantly the city became a football town, with the Steelers winning four Super Bowls in six seasons.

No team has more Super Bowl victories (6) than the Steelers. Also, Chuck Noll is the winningest coach with four Super Bowl crowns. Bill Cower and present head coach Mike Tomlin also have Super Bowl victories. 

Notable Steelers in the Pro Football Hall of Fame: Lynn Swann, Jack Lambert, Jack Ham, ""Mean"" Joe Greene, Terry Bradshaw, founder Art ""The Chief"" Rooney, Chuck Noll, Mike Webster, Dan Rooney, Franco Harris, and many more. Steeler fans want the Hall of Fame to open a Steeler's wing to accommodate all of the players in the hall and future Hall of Famers.

 I have a 9 month old daughter and I was so looking forward to taking her to her very first Steeler game! Now, she is a very very good baby and in social situations I have been able to take her everywhere. She loves people and loves to take in new and exciting experiences. The point of this is that she would be well behaved, laughing at a Steelers game, and most likely clapping with rowdy fans not throwing a temper tantrum and disrupting the game for others. I would take her out if she was upset, believe me I get it!

I feel that The Steeler organization is trying to weed out the younger crowd by charging full price for a ticket and a seat that a baby can't even use. Most kid friendly places don't charge for Children 2 and under, that includes Aiirlines in the US, museums, fairs, Zoos, Concert Venues, Pitt games(at Heinz Field) Baseball games(PNC park), and many more less opulent businesses.  

As far as the Steelers are concerned even though your child won't be using a seat they have to buy a full price ticket. I asked about Club level seating and yes especially in the club. Which would be the best place to walk around and entertain a youngster if fussy. If you purchase non club seating then it doesn't matter where your baby sits if you have lower level seats. Getting 3 seats together can be much pricier than a pair and are harder to find. I asked why this was the policy and an unfriendly person told me that ""Steeler Policy states that gate operator is not incumbent to assess a childs age of 2 or under so they do not have the resources available for gate entry for people in line entering the stadium.""

Sorry but considering the Pirates allow free entry under 2 and offer discounted tickets for children under 2 if they want to participate in the activities for children's days. So NOT COOL STEELERS!",1,5GS5sBSscgcex0IFTDL9Bg,1,2,2013-08-20,review,5

First-Hand Experience: I've seen the Steelers play both home and away, and they won every single time. I saw them at Three Rivers. I saw them at Heinz. I saw them play in Cinci. Every single time I see them live in person, they win. And they win Superbowls too, whenever I happen to be watching. If I'm not watching (cough cough Packers) they lose.

     New stars like fullback Will Johnson and running back Le'Veon Bell emerged as new stars at 50th  Pittsburgh Steeler Training Camp in 2015 at Chuck Noll Field at Saint Vincent College in Latrobe,PA  Bell's up the middle rushes and Johnson's catching and then running with the football were highlights of the day.
  
     In his 12th year as the Steelers starting quarterback, Ben Roethlisberger passed with ease. Only wearing a white sleeveless t-shirt and yellow and black pants, he easily threw short touchdown passes to 11 year veteran Heath Miller. He caught several quick receptions on short passes in the end zone from Roethlisberger. 

    Wide receiver Markus Wheaton, an up and coming star for the Steelers, made several large receptions down the field. 

     For his 10th year in the NFL, Bruce Gradkowski looked great too making completions to Miller and Wheaton. 

    New defensive coordinator Keith Butler had great Steeler defense. They made great goal line stops.  Plus linebackers coach Joey Porter had them perform with great pass coverage. 

    10th year Steeler Head Coach Mike Tomlin endured the heat of Chuck Noll Field with his black hat, sweat shirt, and sweat pants intensely watching each player. He hopes to lead the Steelers to another Super Bowl.

iTmWHtltCtk0Gm55AOxrUA,rHogJ02dqRKBgBFS7Lkheg,"O my Pittsburgh Pirates.  What a storied history you have!  But the last time you went to the post season was in 1992,  and I remember it well.    I worked as a ticket taker at the old Three Rivers Stadium and I have such fond memories of working there.  I was 17 when you won your last divisional title and I don't think you've had a winning season in my entire adult life.

Don't get me wrong, my Bucs!  I do love you so much.  In a way, I have to.  See, you're like the boy I knew in grammar school who was such a sweet kid, but he was constantly failing his classes--and he lived in a nice house!  

Let's take a look at your records since 2000.  I warn you dear Pirates--it won't be pretty.  But it's something you have to come to terms with:

2001:  62-100 (last pl)
2002:  72-89 (4th Pl)
2003:  75-87 (4th pl)
2004:  72-89 (5th pl)
2005:  67-95 (last)
2006:  67-95 (5th pl)
2007:  68-94 (last)
2008:  67-95 (last)
2009:  62-99 (last)
2010:  56-101 (last)*     *As of 09-29-2010

So that's six seasons in last place, two 100 loss seasons, and this season has been the worst so far.

Yes, I'll still go to your games next season.  I'll still go with my husband, my co-workers, and my Girl Posse.  My dad and I will still have our father-daughter nights out here.  But like the parents of that sweet little boy in grammar school with the failing grades, you're really trying my patience.

I wasn't expecting a World Series Champ or even a Pennant winner.  But was a winning season too much to ask for?  This marks the 20th anniversary since the Pirates' last winning season.  That's right folks--it's been since 1992.  Let's take a look at the world of 1992.

BASEBALL:  The Pirates' roster that year included Stan Belinda, Doug Drabek, Zane Smith, Denny Neagle, Jay Bell, Orlando Merced, Andy Van Slyke, and of course Barry Bonds.  All have since retired.  The only new ballparks were New Comiskey Park (now U.S. Cellular Field) and Camden Yards.  No stadiums had corporate names.  The Arizona Diamondbacks, the Colorado Rockies, the Miami Marlins, and the Tampa Bay (Devil) Rays didn't exist.  The Washington Nationals were the Montreal Expos.  The Milwaukee Brewers were in the AL.  Both the NL and the AL only had two divisions each.  The minor league Washington Wild Things didn't exist either and nor did their league.  KBL was the big cable sports channel.

TV:  ""Saturday NIght Live's"" cast included Dana Carvey, Ellen Cleghorne, Chris Farley, Tim Meadows, Mike Myers, Kevin Nealon, Phil Hartman,  Chris Rock, Adam Sandler, Rob Schneider, and David Spade.  ""Seinfeld"" hadn't become a huge hit yet and no one knew Kramer's first name.  Monday nights on NBC included ""Murphy Brown"", ""Evening Shade"" and "" Northern Exposure"".

MOVIES:  The top movies included ""Lethal Weapon 3"", ""Basic Instinct"", ""Hone Alone 2"", ""The Bodyguard"" and ""Aladdin"".  When you wanted to watch movies at home, you had to rent them from the video store and you watched them on VHS tapes or laserdiscs.  

MUSIC:  Bruce Springsteen released ""Lucky Town"" and ""Human Touch""  on the same day.  R.E.M. had ""Automatic for the People"".  Gin Blossoms released their first album ""New Miserable Experience"", which stayed on the charts for almost two years.  Bare Naked Ladies ""Gordon"" featured the cult classic ""If I Had a Million Dollars.""  You either listened to albums on cassette or CD and you bought them at record stores like National Record Mart.  Doug Hopkins (Gin Blossoms), Kurt Cobain (Nirvana), Shannon Hoon (Bline Melon) and Jerry Garcia (Grateful Dead) were all alive.

TECHNOLOGY:  Few people had internet access.  You also used pay phones because you didn't have a cell phone.  You watched movies on a VCR.  You met up with your friends without texting them.  You ordered merchandise by ""sending in"" or by calling an ""800"" number.  You had to buy tickets by waiting in line.  

And OJ Simpson was still a football hero.

So that's it, Pittsburgh Pirates.  I feel like telling you I'm done with you guys.  I'm no fair weather fan, but 20+ years of losing is enough.",2,fB7XYJYrTtchlTmzSQVMbQ,2,1,2012-10-02,review,2

2rSeth60_CuWN3ZJ4k41lg,j_xydMrB-lLF4oq3JpS4oA,"The Pittsburgh Pirates just had their first winning season in twenty years.  They made the playoffs and got Pittsburgh excited for baseball again.  So what would you rate the pirates front offices right now?  Are the pirates going to be in the pennant race for years to come or will they be one and done? 
                Neil Huntington became the Pittsburgh Pirates general manager 6 years ago.  Their minor league system ranked near the bottom half of the MLB when he first started.  Now they are rated in the top three minor league systems in all of baseball.  
                Neil has done a great job drafting the best players available in the MLB amateur drafts in his tenure.  His first pick was Pedro Alvarez.  The first Manager that he hired was John Russell.  I think that was a terrible hire but I do know what Neil was thinking.  The Pirates were not going to contend for the next three years at least.  So they just wanted to get a guy in there that would do what they wanted and try to teach their young players baseball and keep them motivated.  They soon fired Russell and made a terrific hire in Clint hurdle.  In the coming years in the draft the Pirates drafted Jamison Taillon, Tony Sanchez, and Gerit Cole.  Three of these draftees are significant parts of the major league team right now.  Tallion will join the Pirates by mid season this year.  I give the Pirates a grade A in drafting in these last 6 years.  Before 2008, Pirates management would draft the player who they could sign the easiest and not the best player available.  Now by drafting the best players available they have made their minor league system and their major league team one of the best in the majors.
                Another big factor in the team's most recent success and their future is their international signings.  Before Neil Huntington and Pirates owner Bob Nutting there were no Pirates facilities in Latin America.  That was a huge piece the Pirates were missing.  Roberto Clemente is from the Dominican Republic and all of the DR Players were going to other teams and not the Pirates.  The Pirates built a brand new facility in the DR and now they have some impact players to help the Pirates now and into the future.  The biggest signing so far has been Starling Marte.  In 2004 the Pirates hired Renee gayo to be director of their Latin America baseball operations.  His first signee was Starling Marte and he signed him for a measly $100,000.  He is now one of the top left fielders in the game.  Gayo also signed the Pirates number one prospect Gregory Polanco for $150,000.  He should be in Pittsburgh by midsummer this year.  He has the potential to be better that Marte and MVP Andrew McCutchen.  The two signings and a multiple other signings are leading the pirates to a very successful short term and long term future.
                Overall I really like what I see from this Pirate team and management.  Yes I would have liked them to sign a few guys over the off season but I trust they know what they are doing.  They are relying heavily on their farm system to carry them through this year.  They might have to make a trade or two if this plan doesn't work but they have a good young core in Pittsburgh that should allow them to have another successful 2014 and for several years to come.",0,fB7XYJYrTtchlTmzSQVMbQ,0,4,2014-02-12,review,0

9HCfCmd0t5GErgm7He6AeQ,PGSfpKicm_RyFywum8-UAA,"There are two ways to go about rating my home team. Either what type of season they are having or the great players from yesteryear and now that has made this team part of the city of champions.

While it is true the Pirates are currently on a losing steak which we had suffered for 19 years straight until the last couple of seasons, there were years when we hoisted the World Series pennant and have some of our greatest players in the Baseball hall of fame.

I began watching the Pirates in my early years when they played at Forbes Field and later Three Rivers stadium both of which are now demolished. They now play at PNC park (reviewed separately) with spectacular views of the city.

PNC park pays tribute to the great players of yesteryear including Honus Wagner, Roberto Clemente, Bill Mazeroski, and Willie Stargell to name a few. There is a section at the Heinz history center devoted to the Pirates.  Our star player today is Andrew McCutcheon. Still it is a thrill for kids to run the bases as well as have special events planned when the team plays at home.

In addition the team has hosted the All Star game several times out of which I fortunate to go to one of them when they played at Three Rivers Stadium.

Still their continually losing streak is a sense of frustration since it makes going to the games somewhat worthless. It will be nice if they could turn things around as we approach the mid season to make the game more exciting.

Pirate merchandise is available both online and at PNC park and let's not forget our mascot the Pirate parrot! Go Bucs and here's hoping you can come from behind in 2016",5,fB7XYJYrTtchlTmzSQVMbQ,3,3,2016-06-18,review,5

9Ify25DK87s5_u2EhK0_Rg,9jg1Qvfltf9_w5X0AmqFYQ,"Don's Diner is a very well kept secret.  I first heard about it from a very friendly waitress at one of my favorite spots and then again from a personal friend - both highly recommended Don's Diner for breakfast.  In trying to get more info online, it's slim pickings.  Thank goodness I found a review from Munch at the Post-Gazette so I could be prepared to order the good stuff: 

http://www.post-gazette.com/stories/life/munch/munch-goes-to-dons-diner-on-the-north-side-139980/

First, if you have no idea where this place is, it is, quite literally, under a bridge.  If your GPS seems to be taking you on a wild goose chase, you're getting closer.  There is a convenient parking lot just next to the building.  It looks small from the outside and inside it's even smaller.  Just a few booths and some seats at the counter.  I was glad I had asked my friend before I got there if it was cash only because a sign above the register tells you that as you walk in.  I took a seat at one of the cozy booths, just next to some of Pittsburgh's finest and waited for my friends.  

I browsed the menu for my options but had my mind made up once I saw the pancake special: two pancakes, two eggs, bacon and potatoes.  Thanks to Munch's review, I knew to upgrade my bacon to the thick cut.  I also added some Texas toast for my dippy eggs.  The fluffy pancakes arrived first.  I apologized to my friends for not waiting until their food arrived to dig in, but they forgave me when I offered to share these deliciously light clouds that needed just a few drops of syrup.  The bacon upgrade was also a key component to making this a great breakfast.  My two eggs were gigantic.  The yolks were the largest I have ever seen and made for some great dipping.  My friend wondered why the home fries were so good and I had to tell her it was because I saw Don preparing them at the grill and brushing butter on top.  It gave them a beautiful golden hue and the most divinely tasty crunch.  Even with my extras, upgrades and coffee my bill was still under $10.  

I want to highly recommend Don's Diner to anyone I meet - but then I don't.  I think many local regulars want to keep Don's to themselves and I understand; I now want to keep this secret all to myself.  So I guess I should say I don't mind recommending it...as long as you don't tell anyone else.",2,2cupks8QYzFpMYDiysGOug,2,5,2012-04-16,review,6

Don's is tucked underneath a bridge and looks unassuming. The cuisine: also unassuming, yet delicious. Upon seeing breakfast sandwiches listed for $2.25 my friend chuckled and said, ""I'll take 7."" Most expensive sandwich on the menu was $7.

We took our seats and ordered a Wet Judy and a typical egg breakfast. Both were delicious and I had a craving for a Wet Judy for DAYS. So much messy egg goodness on a sandwich. Upgrade to the thick cut bacon if you get it. Which you should. It's a new favorite.

Waitress came over and said she didn't recognize us and asked if it was our first time. You betcha. She showed us laminated pictures of a film that was shot at the booth to our left and explained how long her father had owned the place. 

Place is cash only, but nothing less should be expected from Don. Thank you for a delicious, classic, Pittsburgh brunch. Can't wait to be back!",1,2cupks8QYzFpMYDiysGOug,1,5,2015-11-16,review,1

JdiVXL4xF2NtnseJqkhYKA,VtAc0vfqQI_w9oP5aSByXg,"To quote another blog ""I ate a lot of red meat this week."" I have to blame (in a good way) Tom Friday's for the switch in my diet.  The meats offered at this small neighborhood market are fresh and quality. The price is affordable. . .for example this week my fiance and I dined on an amazing seasoned brisket for less then $5.00 each. The seasoning was perfect, the cooking instructions they provided when I asked worked without a single hitch, and the beef was tender and juicy even when well-done (which is how I like my meat cooked).

They advertise their fresh Italian sausage (hot and sweet) - which is stocked new each Friday.  Also worth while is their ground beef (we easily go through a couple of lbs of ground beef a week between the two of us).  A slab of ribs will cook up tasty and tender on the grill, without needing to boil or marinade for hours. I have yet to try many of their other offerings - but I am sure I will at some point!

Also check out the hot dog and hamburger buns - they are fresh and delicious!!

The service is also friendly and helpful.  If I could adjust anything it would be the hours - they close at 5:00 each day and are not open on Sundays.  Thus, you have to make that effort to get their on Saturdays if you are not right near by in the neighborhood!",2,obAdXU3RULuUOww759_h_w,0,5,2007-07-06,review,3

I've had several of their offerings including the pre-made hoagies (yummy) and homemade kielbasa (perfectly seasoned).  Their ground meat makes the most delectible burgers.  The huge cuts of steak I've had were always the freshest.  And I'm always a fan of the popular butter steaks.

With that said there is a jewel in the crown of Pittsburgh's Northside called 'Wise guys pizza'. Their menu has a lot of great gangster names and sayings, and adds a bit of mystic to ordering for first timers. Specials like 'The Don', The GODFATHER,  'the Luca Brazzi' fish and The KINGPIN. Additionally there are phrases like; side action, and a hoagie you can't refuse. While the menu is good, it isn't the star of the show. My experience with Wiseguys is that their food is a GREAT meal for a GREAT price. Their salads A#1, their wings not too greasy, fatty, OR dry. To quote my friend Goldilocks,  these wings are JUST RIGHT. Now earlier in this review I spoke of stars. The star of Friday nights show was the cheese steak hoagie. Brimming w/meat FRESH I say again fresh vegetables, and (a pgh thing) fries. Me, and my two growing carnivores left our dinner table quite sated.  Have I eaten there before yes will I eat there again oh heck yes. They are a good bang for your buck with several specials everyday. I end my reviews with this statement and my review of Wiseguys pizza will be no different. I vote with my money and feet, and rest assured that both will be making many more trips to this eatery.

I will start with the good. Service is pretty good.

The place smells of smoke. Why? Because you can smoke in the bar and there is an opening from the bar into the restaurant. This has to be a violation of the no smoking in dining areas in Pittsburgh. Gross. 

The floor (carpeted) is so old that it is sticky and worn down. Walking on it with shoes on disgusted me. The walls have wall paper torn off throughout the place. Please, remodel! At least make me feel like the place is clean. If I feel like it is dirty in the dining hall, I can't imagine it's clean in the kitchen.

Now for the food. I am pretty picky about seafood. It needs to be fresh and cooked correctly. Don't get the Salmon or Tuna Steak. Tuna and Salmon should be easy to get right if you just season and cook it properly. Both tasted very fishy to me. Salmon that tastes overly fishy, to me, screams ""this fish is not fresh"". Mashed potatoes are not made from real potatoes. Don't get them unless you are looking to eat boxed potatoes. I get it, you wanna have a mom and pop shop. But to do that you need to have great food.

Overall, I just don't think this place is good, and don't want to go back.",1,YUZVBdGmagwXV-yOhR-1GQ,1,2,2011-12-30,review,3
9Ify25DK87s5_u2EhK0_Rg,HGDJi52sqDsp0AFbSqqXpg,"After seeing a Google Offer for Miller's, my Mom mentioned how she had been there before and remembered good food and fond memories from her childhood.  So I offered to go with her and see if the food was still as good.  

Once we were seated and greeted by our waitress, we presented the paperwork for our Google Offer.  The waitress handed it to the hostess.  I guess they have to call for us to redeem it/verify that it's legit.  Well apparently one of the numbers was missing off the print-out and the hostess could not have been more rude about it.  In the end she talked to someone and figured it out, but she made it seem like we did something wrong.  Or, she could have told us there was a problem but then politely taken care of it since it is her job and there wasn't much else going on for her to do.  Or she could have talked to someone in the first place and quietly resolved the matter without us even knowing there was a problem to begin with.  I later noticed signs up all over the place about restrictions with restaurant.com offers - I guess they have several patrons who use those regularly.  Apparently with this kind of reception, no one wants to pay full price.

Mom and I both ordered the fish sandwich with mac n cheese.  The mac n cheese was creamy and the fish sandwich was a large portion and very tasty.  I ended up having to eat mine with a knife and fork, not even attempting to lift and eat it as a sandwich.  We left with full and happy tummies.

To comment on previous reviews....yes, this is not the cleanest place.  But I expected that and find it part of the charm.  The smoke from the bar is no longer an issue as a closed door separates the bar area from the dining room.

Overall, it was a larger than average portion for a good fish sandwich.  I'd like to give it 3 stars at least, but the whole attitude from the hostess still left a bad taste in my mouth that the mac n cheese couldn't wash away.",1,YUZVBdGmagwXV-yOhR-1GQ,2,2,2012-07-04,review,2

The waitress was good.  I think she knew we weren't all that pleased with our food even though we told her it was good.

The food....my daughter-in-law had the shrimp scampi.  We are pros at making our own at home, but when it was served, I told her that there are variations to it.  Her first bite she made a sour face.  My son and I then tasted it...understood the face after that.  Way too much lemon juice in it, soaked in oil and not quite sure what the seasoning was, but seemed like pesto.  The pasta was overcooked and the shrimp just sort of were there. 

My son and I had the fried seafood platter.  Aside from overcooked breading and soaked in grease, the oysters were raw, and the battered fish had no flavor.  The breaded shrimp tasted weird too.  Needless to say, none of us finished our food. Underneath the food, the plate had a puddle of grease. 

On the upside, the coleslaw, bread, and crab cake was good.  The make and cheese was edible, but seemed to comparable to Stauffer's.

This was our first, and more than likely, our last, visit.  For a $65 dollar meal, it wasn't worth $10. .",1,YUZVBdGmagwXV-yOhR-1GQ,1,2,2013-11-15,review,2

I got hooked on this bakery while living in Brighton Heights.  Now, when I drive past, I HAVE to stop.  I think this one is so much better than the sister store in West View.  I don't know why; I just like it better.

The sweetest ladies run this local bakery, and they always serve with a smile.  It's usually pretty fast too!  And they're CHEAP.  Doughnuts and giant muffins for $.65.  Cookies of all shapes and sizes are delicious and cheap as well.  It makes me so happy.  Some favorites:

All of the doughnuts:  Raised or cake, cream or jelly, chocolate or vanilla, they're ALL SO GOOD.  I wish I could stop and say no.  But I just can't.  The selection here doesn't go too fast.  I can usually still get one around lunch time, but if you want options, go early.

Lemon Poppyseed Muffin:  They run out quick, but they're so yummy!  It usually triumphs over the doughnuts.

Thumbprint cookies:  Maybe I just love the cookie, but I really like them here too!

Is the cliental a little special sometimes?  You bet.  Are the hours old fashioned early to open and early to close?  Yup.  But I just view it as absence makes the heart grow fonder.... :)",11,N2DwycuZl95miWf39Yskaw,8,4,2014-01-17,review,10

T_wjLgPOPXry7Bea4MzoVQ,TW2meXzC0EN8YqzHJzfODA,"I was somewhat apprehensive due to an article that I had previously read about this Vet.  Luckily I had also found additional information to refute those articles.  Why lucky, you ask?  Because this is a great little office nestled off the main drag in Dormont.  Yeah, it's a bit of a drive from Pittsburgh proper, but they are also open later to help with the fact that some of us actually work for a living.

It is a very small waiting room and you really don't want to have to wait due to the different animals that are continually coming through the door -- that is vet common sense -- so make certain you call ahead to get an appointment.  All of the associates were well mannered and fawned over my little Sophie.  All of the paperwork was filled out for us and were were quickly taken back to one of the exam rooms.  Typical exam room with easily cleaned metal table and linoleum floors.

The Vet-Tech was very knowledgeable and seemed truly interested in making certain my puppy was taken care of.  A little preachy near the end, I let it slide knowing why she was saying it -- positive reinforcement for the puppies is the only way to go people, believe it.  The doctor came in soon after and did the full exam on Sophie.  He was quick and methodical, but at no time did I hear my pup whine.  He pointed out things that he saw and gave Sophie her preliminary vaccinations.  

And then all was done.  At no point did he try to up-sell me.  At no point did he or his associates try to give me anything that was not needed.  He was straightforward and plain in his language and he answered all of my questions truthfully.  How do I know?  I already knew the answers to my questions.  I am fairly protective of my Boston Terriers; and as a small breed they have some health idiosyncracies and nuances that many vets don't know about.  He knew the answers.   I was happy.  

At the end of the visit, they even gave me the records without hesitation.  This office is great.  I will definitely return when I am in the area.",4,titJ-ofqKMG9d0i9_kkX6A,2,5,2009-12-03,review,5

I had two rats and Dr. Dorn was excellent with both. He was the best vet I could have hoped for. 

With rats, it's sometimes hard to find (even highly experienced) vets who understand that a rat has a personality and bonds with its owner to the same degree as a dog--many people act like pet rats are just large gerbils. Dr. Dorn understood, and never made me feel silly about being anxious about them. He calmed my pets down and they loved him immediately, even falling asleep during the exam. He never tried to up-sell, and when one rat had an operable tumor (a $200 surgery) he didn't make me feel guilty for choosing euthanasia instead (he was a very old rat). When the time came, the entire staff was incredibly patient with me, and let me spend as much time as I needed in the private exam room with my rat. Afterwards, they even sent me a condolence card. 

The vet techs were all professional and cheerful. The small office seemed like a friendly, casual environment. Exams for a rat were around $60 with medicine and so forth... I can't remember the specific prices, but they seemed reasonable. They were always able to see me on the same day I called.

So when it comes to your kitties health, you want someone to take it seriously!  I've thankfully only had to deal with them twice before.  Once for the round of kitten vaccines and neutering.  I believe for the two kittens it was around $175.  

The other issue I had was that my one cat had pretty gross eye junk (obviously technical terms I avoid).  The vet who saw me was incredibly friendly and very gentle with my little furry friend.  They were able to fill my prescription of eye drops right away so I wouldn't have to worry about it coming in.  About $50 later I was on my way.

I grew up raising puppies as a family hobby and became very attached to quality care from a vet in my hometown. My standards for a vet are high and I was more than pleasantly surprised by WLAH. 

My first experience with Dr. Dorn was no more than 2 weeks after my adoption of my dog. I was pretty certain that she had UTI and it was confirmed. He was such a nice doctor and all of his staff was understandable and sweet. It also felt like a family environment and the office building is adorable. I didn't feel like I was taking my dog to some overly commercial MedVet (the worst place you can go) or chain. The whole appointment, plus medicine, plus taking out her stitches (for free) was $45. I was in shock! It was very reasonable.

DLu1Bum8EXNE62xno-v0VA,NwI1id2OQcR8xRLASuFjCw,"Let's be honest: taking our pets to the vet for anything other than a routine check-up can be nerve-wracking. Going to the right vet's office can really help with that anxiety, and for my family and I this animal hospital is the perfect place to take our beloved pets.

My family has taken our pets to this practice as far back as I can remember. While the team here hasn't cared for our house's entire little zoo over the years (which has seen everything from crabs to frogs to guinea pigs and more), they have helped us take care of our old rabbit and two cats. And I have to say the staff have never disappointed. Most recently they've often accommodated my family at the last minute when our cats took a sudden downhill turn, and when we come in they handle our pets wonderfully and kindly. One staff member once even asked for my permission before they brought in their interns and trainees to see my cat, who has a rare scar formation in her eye; given the stress that can surround a vet visit it meant a lot to me that this person checked with me before she used my cat as a teaching vehicle, rather than simply dragging their entire staff in to stare at my poor kitty.

I know that some of their services can be a little pricier (surgeries in particular can seem a bit high if you've ever gotten estimates from shelters for the same procedures), but given their status as a local independent group I understand why this is the case. And on another important note, I strongly advise fellow pet owners to bring their animals either in crates or with proper leashes, restraints, etc. as needed, as this office does have a small wait room and that means it's super important for all owners to both have control over and to protect the animals they bring to this office. That said, I've never had a problem with my two kitties, my old rabbit, or any other owners' animals to date.

I absolutely recommend this vet's office to other pet owners. Its location is excellent for people like me (even if its parking lot is a little small), and its fantastic staff have never disappointed and have always done what's right for my beloved pets. I admittedly hope that I don't need to be back any time soon, but it's good to know that this place is here and can provide the top-top service they do when I and my dear pets need their help.",1,titJ-ofqKMG9d0i9_kkX6A,0,4,2015-03-04,review,1

The crystals are organized by the zodiac. For those who are metaphysically geared, this means you can pick out your stones by whether you are a Pisces, Aries, Sagittarius, etc. Though I didn't realize it at first, when I did, it was really, really helpful in helping me pick out the stone I wanted. 

Lots of beautiful crystal jewelry pieces and unusual stones. You go to most shops and they don't have half of the selection Moonstones does. Had something called Maw sit sit, which, being an avid crystal hunter, I'd never seen that before and was totally surprised about. 

They also have a great selection of jewelry pieces for Wicca path, Goddess symbolism, and other Earth-based followings, which you don't usually see. 

Crystal gridders! For a metaphysical store, the amount and diversity of small grid style stones was great. If I had a local client who was looking for crystals to grid their home, I'd suggest Moonstones. Picking out crystals online is difficult and oft, disappointing - so it's best to pick them out in person. This is a great place if you are looking to grid something. 

I bought a beautiful pendant while there and got a cool book as well. Overall A+ in 'stuff they have.' 

In the end, shoplifting fears of the owner aside - the stones were great and I got a cool book.

Giant Eagle offers a lot of things, but they don't offer me everything I am looking for when I go shopping.  Kuhn's, on the other hand, offers all of those little idiosyncrasies and nuances that I look for that I cannot find anywhere else.  The biggest thing for me is the fact that they carry Boar's Head brand luncheon meats.  I really don't know how anyone eats any other brand of luncheon meat since they all just taste so stale in comparison.  

I can tell that a higher number of Italian-American folk patronize this store as well.  Why? The pasta selection is awesome.  I despise the typical noodles carried everywhere else; but here I can find the noodles that I have grown to love.  

Getting beyond the reasons above, I do enjoy the store as a whole and the fact that I can find what I am looking for.  I will definitely be returning; I just have to make certain to be careful of the parking situation since this particular store's parking lot layout is prone to jamming.

Washington, this is a welcome change. I actually was excited to move to Dormont knowing we'd potentially have a better place to grocery shop locally.

Kuhn's has absolutely surpassed Foodland. It's clean, has most everything I need and it's at the right price. I'm actually surprised how much variety they offer in such a ""small"" space. Small being the operative word, considering most Giant Eagle's are ginormous. 

I've even discovered new products here, like my delicious Lara Fiber Bars. I'm surprised at the nice gourmet cheese selection, the big deli area and even a counter for fresh seafood. So now I can just run down the block if I need to pick up something quick or do my whole week's shopping here. It's glorious! 

The only thing I wish for is a better parking lot. Since I'm coming off Dwight Ave it's nice to sneak right in. But coming out is another issue. There's only one way traffic around the parking lot. So you're usually stuck waiting behind cars trying to park and pull out. This is very minor though... just an impatient person talking here.

DLu1Bum8EXNE62xno-v0VA,C12l014KavLO7M6EZ5yQ-w,"So I have to ask myself, why don't I shop here more often? My family and I tend to shop at Giant Eagle, partly because of the large size of their stores and partly because of their GetGo rewards. Kuhn's has somehow become the place we stop when we don't have time to drive to Giant Eagle. 

Which is totally a shame, because whenever I DO stop in here I'm reminded about how nice the place actually is. Today a simple trip for milk turned into a fall-themed decoration shopping spree that went really well (yay super cute owl pillows!) and I ended up picking some breakfast and lunch items as well just because of how cheap they were. I know from past experience that the produce is fresh, and between the wonderful aroma and colorful display the bakery here is absolutely torturous to pass. There's also a ready-made dinner/lunch shelf with sandwiches, chicken wings, pizzas and a few dessert items if you want to grab those on your way out; I've actually gotten dinner here a few times on my way home from the city when I was too tired to cook. What's not to like about affordable and delicious food, right?

However, there is at least one thing that does keep me from wanting to be a regular here and giving Kuhn's a 5 star review: the blasted parking lot you have to deal with to go here, which I've cursed in other reviews. This lot is the one that fills up super quickly, creates miniature traffic jams like no one's business, and is a time-stealing trap. Sigh. Suddenly I think I understand why my family always goes to Giant Eagle.

The baked goods are another plus. The cakes here actually taste like cake from a bakery. Not many grocery stores can make such a claim. Checking out at Kuhn's is also a breeze. They actually have plenty of staff on registers, so as to keep lines moving, and very short-unlike S&S and Big Bird. And there are none of those damned self check outs. If I'm giving a store my business, I shouldn't have to check myself out, because they are too cheap to properly staff the place (I'm talking to YOU Giant Eagle). In addition, the prices here typically LOWER than S&S and Big Bird.

my hair base is a honey blonde and i had both older (all over) and newer (6 months old crown only) highlights.  i went in for a highlight consult before i bought a groupon to assess experience.  i thought the consult could have been MUCH stronger but i felt comfortable that she knew what she was doing.  she wrapped a full head, processed with heat (but would have preferred to process without heat given we were bleaching on bleach--never a good idea), washed, conditioned, cut and styled in about 2.5+ hours which is about standard in a busy salon but fast for a personally owned one (IMHO).

the pros:
* it was mostly a quiet service (i hate smalltalk)
* it was a quick but pretty precise wrap (thought it could have been closer to scalp)
* i got a full head, cut, and style for $60 with groupon
* i got the color and cut result i wanted and i'm a super picky client

the cons:
* they don't quote a service price upfront which included no mention of a $10 extra product charge
* condition of my hair, not bad but not good, which was to be expected but i saw what i consider to be too much breakage that she was downplaying but would have been less so processing without heat.  i'm going to condition the h3ll out of it for the next few weeks
* i asked for sliced foils (that results in chunkier highlights) and i got weaved.  when i asked she why are we weaving them, she said that with a week old root regrowth that slicing would look bad (i disagree because slicing is the way i like them done).  i thought her advice sharing could have been handled better, but i let it go
* i didn't want my ends bleached (i was willing to deal with reverse ""hombre""), though she did reduce the peroxide at the ends with a 2nd mixture, it was still touching the higher mixture at midshaft, given the way she foiled)
* heat processing on already processed lightened hair but i didn't speak up and tried to rely on her expertise
* the owner had a tendency to complain about her staff and about not being able to find good talent (true but unprofessional to me).  besides that, which i could live with, this tells me that i would never use another person in her salon if she weren't available (not good for her business)

the owner, as should be expected, was diligent about product (shampoo, conditioner, shine emollient) and service upsells (glaze, toner, deep conditioner) and i didn't want any of it.  while i understand this, i don't buy salon product (EVER) as i get it at wholesale so at first i just didn't respond but eventually i said i have more product than i could ever use in a lifetime and that even if i weren't, that i'm on a tight budget.  but she continued to push when it would have been more appropriate to concede on the extras to push up the cost total.

the owner is going to do things her way if you let her.  if you're ok with that, then good, if you're an input and very hair tech knowledgeable client such as myself, you're going to get resistance.

overall, the service itself was good, the customer service was soso but i would go back for either a cut or color and i would insist upfront no product and service upselling",0,7ArW9lGBoSNOWIY5myDLWw,0,4,2014-05-29,review,1

These guys will treat you with respect, and answer any questions you have in as great detail as you desire whether you are buying a $10 accessory, a $30 repair, or a $2000 bike. Furthermore, if you need a repair they treat you the same whether you have a top-of-the-line bike or a Walmart bike.  Before he got sick, my father bought me a department store Schwinn right around the time they got iffy. He didn't have a lot of money. His dad had bought him a Schwinn at the same age. With the money I've spent on parts over the years on this bike I could have purchased a premium bicycle. But this obviously hold some sentimental value, so I appreciate their care with it. Also, had an inconvenient problem after I had some maintence done and they fixed it VERY quickly and explained to me in detail (and physically showed me) what was wrong with my bike. I wouldn't go anywhere else.

Problem you'll find in other stores (especially that one on Bethel Church Road):  Snobbery, elitists, over pricing, eye rolls, and entitlement.

But it only gets better, happy hour pints for 90 cents.  So, delicious popcorn + beer= Great afternoon after work.

dapbOj1WwSchUr-7V63IBg,GhnYWokN76DfPliQdjzjaw,"... Look... I hate writing a less than stellar review of a business. It actually makes my cold goth baby heart sad. No one WANTS to go somewhere and get bad service, thats just ludicrous. (Not Ludacris, close but not the same.)

I have just recently moved to Beechview and the best part of moving to a new part of this wonderful city is giving new businesses a try! I have sampled so many tasty and amazing new food items and coffee drinks etc etc. I am always in search of a non-smoking bar where I can hang out, eat, drink, and get to know the locals. I prefer small bars with ""yinzers"" as they tend to be a true gauge of a neighborhood for me. 

We have many friends in this area, which means that we got some great tips before we even moved in about different types of food, stores, laundromats, and bars. One of these tips, repeated from friend to friend, was The Huddle. As the name implies it is a bar where you can be certain you can watch a sports game of whatever sport-ball type you're interested in. It is indeed non-smoking, a handful of tables suitable for 4 people and a ""U"" shaped bar right in the center as soon as you come in. It is a cash only establishment with an ATM on site for quick transactions. The have free popcorn from a popcorn machine which makes the place smell amazing. It's been around quite a while which means that there is a great group of locals who frequent the establishment. 

This is truly everything I need in a local bar. We had been in for the very first time for drinks shortly after moving in and happened to be in there on one of their two weekly wing nights. This are not the wee tiny wings, more a weird in between of some of the ""full"" size wings I've had other places that clearly came from giant monster mutant chickens (I mean maybe they were goose wings, who even knows... they were huge) and the teeny tiny wing night wings you find most other places. They have two options; buffalo (sloppy) and ""tanned"" which are buffalo then cooked again so they are drier and crisp and un-freaking-believeable. The prices are mega cheap and it's so filling and delicious we've been back more than once for them. I like this place so much we have even taken the handsome-boyfriend's mother there when she was in town for the weekend. (P.S. She loved it too!) 

My dear sweet lovely readers, here is where I have to talk about something less than all of the amazing parts I've already mentioned. Tonight, both ravenous from too little food and too much work-day, we trekked up the monster that is Coast Avenue for beers and food and a chill environment (that would undoubtably involve pre-season football). We walk in the door and aside from an employee (other than the bartender) and a few people in the back at tables, we are the only patrons aside from one regular. We belly up to the bar on the far side and say our hellos. This is where I get a serious case of the sad. The bartender working seemed annoyed by our presence. Ok, I get it... I work sort of indirectly with the public I have days where I can't handle people. It happens! As customers come in and sit down, she greets them with a warmth that was clearly lacking. Ok. That's sort of disappointing but still fine. When we got to the point that we asked for a menu three times while she retrieved menus and took orders for the people next to us an hour after we came in... thats where I start to have an issue with the service. Eventually we decided to leave because I was tipping over the line to ""hangry"" and was afraid I'd lose my temper after the 3rd time we had asked for menus and didn't get them while she continued to warmly greet other patrons and provide them menus and take their orders while refilling our beers seemed to be an annoyance to her to the point of not even asking if we wanted another or the same beer and just taking the glass and starting to fill it (wherein I had to stop her because I hadn't asked her for another one and actually just wanted the tab cashed out).

Yes, of course I'll give it another try, I want this to be my local hang out bar. My service in sitting at the table or being served by the woman I presume is the owner has been great.

Wouldn't you like to get away?

Yea yea- it's nice to go where everybody knows your name, but you know what's even better? A server who knows your drink order and weekly wing order.

Their wings are the best in the city. Now I like a 20 flavor wing sauce list as much as the next guy, but trust that you don't need all of those options. At The Huddle you get 2 sauce choices and you can have those choices wet or tanned. BBQ tanned in my go-to. They slather on that sweet BBQ and then bake it into the wings. The result are wings with crispy, sticky skin and tender, juicy meat. 

The Huddle isn't trying to be fancy or unique. They are serving straight up bar food, but it's pretty good bar food. Also, don't expect 5 star service (but the wings make up for it).

Aside from the wings, I'm a huge fan of their Reuben and their monstrous grilled cheese. Pizza is surprisingly good as well! We usually have a party of 6 on wing night and their pizza is the perfect appetizer to split among the table.

But, feeling particularly poor and without having established a favorite hair person here in Pittsburgh, I took a chance and bought a Groupon for Sergios.  I even made an appointment with someone totally unknown - no yelp reviews, no word of mouth approval, no bio on the website, no nothing!  That's right y'all I can be spontaneous.   Good thing I only had highlights & a trim planned...and lucky me, it was fantastic.

All of the staff seemed uniformly very young and very hip, but still friendly and accommodating.  The music was all 90s and 2000s pop and alternative throwbacks that were such a delight.  And my mystery hairstylist was awesome - Dave not only gave me a really great cut and the most thorough highlighting of my life, but he also charmed my pants off - just a genuine, friendly, interesting fellow.

You can't even get a deal like that at the crappy chain salons!

Also, I was really excited to try the salon after reading that Sergio himself had trained under the talented Robert Cromeans!! The best salon experience I had ever had was at his ARCS salon in Las Vegas, so I had high hopes.

I arrived for my haircut probably a half an hour early. Surprisingly even though they were super packed ( I was there at 6:30) they were able to take me right back. My Stylist was Richie and he was extremely personable.

The salon itself is by far one of the best I've seen in Pittsburgh. All of the stylists were busy with clients and the energy of the place was great. Also great music added so much to the atmosphere.

During my consultation Richie listend to EVERYTHING and I mean EVERYTHING I wanted. I think that's the most important part about being a hairstylist is being able to listen. Needless to say my haircut came out amazing. He took a good chunk of time with me, which was great because I hate feeling rushed in and out of a salon. Not too mention that he gave me the most thorough blowout of my life!

1aoFroIFoCleGBA4dYqOHw,shiUQnkIwACC2cjH7m5GaA,"I had previously written a positive review of Karen at this salon, but now must change it as my most recent experience turned in to a nightmare. A few months back, after reading great reviews of her work, I went to her for a haircut. I was very pleased, so I went back for highlights and a trim. This time around I am extremely upset. Karen left the color on my hair way too long. And my request for a trimming of my ends turned into very short layers in the front going back past my ears and long in the back. Think Carol Brady of the Brady Bunch. She also thinned my hair out, which I absolutely hate because my hair is already very thin. Now I have frizzy, uneven ends that stick out at all different lenghts. There are also bleed marks of color noticeable in the hair line. The worst of it is the damage caused by being over processed. I have severe breakage everywhere especially at the top. I now have a ton of hairs sticking up at the top of my head and my hair over all looks frizzy and fried. It continues to break. I went and showed Sergio the owner who laughed when he saw it saying it was new hair growth, not breakage. Even after I explained that it was not like that until after my hair was done at his salon he stuck to his guns. I would like to say that I am only disappointed by what's happened. But I am very upset. Every girl knows what it feels like to have a bad experience at the salon. Now I have an appointment at another salon and have to pay more money to fix the color, which is very brassy, the highlights that bled and cut after already paying over $150 for the mess I am now left lift.

I made the appointment for 6pm. They called at 1:17 asking why I hadn't shown up for a 1 pm appointment. I told them it was for 6 and they said they were sorry and were able to accommodate me at 6. When  I arrived, I was seated quickly and greeted by a stylist. She said are you here for your cut and color? I explained that no, I had made the appointment only to have extensions cut in. She excused herself and spoke with the owner, Sergio. When she returned a few minutes later she explained that they would not be cutting my hair as they do not cut extensions they don't put in and if I didn't like the cut they'd have to pay for more extensions. I even offered to sign a liability waiver but they refused. So basically, I wasted time getting off work early to come to a salon that refused the service they scheduled me for.

I showed many pictures of how I wanted it to look, but it actually ended up looking like one picture I showed her and said, ""This is NOT what I want my hair to look like"" with a reply from her like so, ""Ew I would never do that to your hair!"" I was really unhappy with it and asked the stylist the next day to fix it but was told that I was wrong and that it would be at least another $85, even though it was her mistake. 

BUT:
A week later, I called Sergio (like I should have in the first place), and explained the whole situation. He was so helpful in explaining everything and offered to have it fixed free of charge (like it should be). I was set up with Dessa this time, and she was amazing! She really listened to how I wanted it fixed while giving her professional opinion and ended up fixing my roots to be the same color as the rest of the color, while toning out the brassiness. The colors match perfectly, and I couldn't be happier. I'm definitely going to go back to her for root maintenance.

C7fAayUgCwlBHC9RlF6tFg,4mZQEJ4OEW2EwvdXcQRGVA,"I was here for an initial set of lash extensions, having worn them for over a year prior. I know how to care for them and am willing to pay for the upkeep, as they make my life easier.  I had a gifted Groupon--which I'm always leery about the service you get with Groupons--but I figured this place had great reviews (for hair, mostly) and had good hours for my work schedule. My appointment about 2 weeks from my call and I showed up 10 minutes early for an appointment on the hour. We got started about 10 minutes after the hour, no biggie.  I thought the appointment finished very quickly, though I wasn't sure if I'd fallen asleep after such a long silence and a very warm room.  I was deposited at the counter after being told to come back in 4 weeks (though she told me, ""I usually tell my clients to come back in 3 weeks, but you can come back in 4). My understanding of an initial natural lash application takes about 1.5-2 hours, and I didn't see anything in Sergio's descriptions that made me think differently. I was done in about 50 minutes, which I'm certain of this based on when I silenced an incoming call at the start of the appt to when I sent a text after getting back to my car. Within 2-2.5 weeks, all the lashes had fallen off, without my lash attached.  No oil-based cleanser, no water for the first 24-48 hours, and I avoid getting shampoo in my eyes when I wash my hair.  I called an let them know and they were super responsive.  The person who did my lashes was no longer there, and the woman who replaced her was great.  They gave me another initial set in the place of my 3-4 week fill that was included in my Groupon. I was asked what I was going for, and I answered ""natural..maybe a little more volume, but not over the top"".  This application took 1.5 hours and it passed quickly.  When I saw them, I was a bit surprised, because they were.....too much for me, much more than I've had in the past. I mentioned it to her that it was a little much, and she assured me it was a natural set.  I was a little leery, but thought that since it was a change, I needed to adjust to it.  Unfortunately, that didn't happen. My husband, who always tries to make me feel good, gave me honest feedback that they looked unlike any lashes I've ever had...and that it wasn't a good look.  That was supported by numerous other comments throughout the next day at work.  Within 24 hours, I had them removed (not at Sergio's) because they weren't felt to be ""professional looking"". I don't really fault Sergio's, as I should have not left there as hesitant as I was, knowing I've never had such obvious extensions before.  That, and I was already tired after a long work day and wanted to be home.   I do appreciate that they were super responsive when I had the initial problem, and would tell others to make sure to speak up.  I'm sure if I called and let them know, they would do whatever was in their power to fix it, but, at this point, my lashes are much shorter and sparser before I had gone in, so I think I'm going to cool it on the extensions.",0,05l84gPaZX2IWaIaoAq3hg,0,3,2016-06-20,review,0
wNtyBJa_qaRYUew_TWplgw,46jQlmf3bMwRafaQvy7L1Q,"Sushi Three is located in a strip of shops on Beverly Road, alongside a coffee shop, florist, several banks, and two pizza places.  This and Little Tokyo are, to my knowledge, the only sushi restaurants in Mt. Lebanon.

Sushi Three has an extensive menu that seems to have expanded since the last time I visited, and has lots more than just sushi.  There is a long list of appetizers, tempuras and teriyaki dishes, and some Chinese offerings.  The main focus, the sushi, takes up a large portion of the menu, and there are many different rolls, ranging from the basic kappa rolls to the complex southside roll (shrimp, smoked eel, fish flakes, cucumber, spinach, mushrooms, egg and caviar).  As a vegetarian, I appreciate the vegetable sushi platter, which I have never seen anywhere else and only costs $12.  There is even a separate vegetarian menu.

While I do appreciate the wide-ranging menu, I just can't like the atmosphere.  It's always very quiet and dark inside, and I always get the feeling of being in a cave.  I prefer to get take-out or delivery.

Our first visit was at lunch and it was just OK. We weren't blown away nor were we impressed. But I will always opt to support a local Mom & Pop shop if all things are equal. This last visit was the pits.

It was 5:30pm on a Saturday night. We were one of two tables. This is usually an indication of something fishy (excuse the pun.) Appetizer was edamame. It was overcooked and left uneaten. I am not the adventurous sushi order-er; I had California rolls and spicy tuna. The tuna rolls were mostly spicy sauce then fish, very mayonnaise-y and unsatisfying. As for my CA rolls, the avocado was all brown! Not just the parts on the top (because I checked!) all the way through. When I brought it to the staff's attention her response was ""Oh, yea. Avocado is like banana. They get brown very easily and we cut that yesterday."" WHAT?!? They did bring me another batch (that was part brown, part green) but it was too late. This was my first sushi restaurant EVER that we left half the rolls on the plate uneaten. Since we were all still hungry, my daughter picked up the table tent listing all the desserts. Yuck! Filthy. Not wiped down in a long while or perhaps ever. When I set it back is when I noticed the wall also needed a good wipe down. Needless to say, we skipped dessert.

DLu1Bum8EXNE62xno-v0VA,oFhQm4gJ6hdv_sQN3PHuXw,"I am a huge fan of Sushi Three. They live within walking distance of my home, so it's no problem getting here and the temptation for sushi is always in the back of my mind! Admittedly, the price of the food here tends to keep my cravings in check for a couple months at a time, but when I do come here, I enjoy every bite. Occasionally I also order take-out since they have very reasonable lunch deals, but really, I prefer to sit and eat at the restaurant itself.

Speaking of: the place itself is very quiet, which I actually like; I can just sit, talk with a friend or read a book, and then (what a radical concept) enjoy my food in peace. This is a big deal for me because the other places I know of where I can get sushi are loud, busy, and quite frankly, a little limiting options-wise compared to Sushi Three's menu. If I want sushi, I either come here or I get a small pack at Giant Eagle. That's how much I dislike eating in the other sushi places I've visited in Pittsburgh to date (although with more and more places opening this opinion may change soon!). If I'm going to pay as much as I do for my fish, I want to be in a place I can sit and actually enjoy my food.

By the way, Sushi Three does serve things other than sushi, so people looking for some Japanese food that isn't rice and fish are definitely going to find something. There's some really delicious beef, chicken and pork dishes (one family member of mine absolutely adores their pork katsudon). But of course, a place with the word ""sushi"" in its name is going to specialize in sushi, and there are pages and pages of sushi options available here. The orders come in various styles and sizes as well, so couples can get something to share or just get something smaller for themselves. The combos all come with soup and salad, which are also very yummy. My personal routine order as of today is a large salad and an order of softshell crab rolls. Sure, I'll occasionally snag a bite from someone here with me, but the truth is that Sushi Three makes such enormous orders that I need to be reeeally hungry to eat all of any other order I make. 

But hey, at least you get your money's worth! I say definitely give this place a shot if you're a sushi fan.",2,QnyzlVMyx0Exri-Lay10cA,2,5,2012-12-08,review,2

For the longest time I could only eat it fresh (not delivery), but this is the second place ever I've found that I thoroughly enjoyed the sashimi appetizer, takosu, flower roll, and a spicy tuna roll with no asparagus. Of the two places ever, this is my new number one. The spicy tuna roll and and sashimi app were my favorites! The hubby got yellowtail fish jowl, and fried rice... Also very good.

bmy45XLtOomcc_EvC-lXRQ,qDDd4rer0sPXH3UbXJHomA,"Sushi Three is my favorite sushi restaurant in Pittsburgh. Their food is always excellent. I've only eaten in the restaurant a couple times, I usually order take out. The vegetable spring rolls are delicious. They are crispy, not greasy & the dipping sauce they come with is so good! It tastes like a wasabi mustard combination. Cold sesame noodles are good. My favorite makisushi is the spicy salmon tempura roll, they fry the outer shell of the sushi so it's crispy & it's lightly topped with sauce. The Shadyside Roll which is smoked salmon, cream cheese & avocado, any of the vegetable tempura rolls which is a choice of yam, broccoli, asparagus or zucchini & the fresh salmon roll are all great choices.

BCDRMjjM07Bp7Du2iZpg9w,YISeUEemHUx3xE8QEbyURA,"I've been coming to Sushi 3 since high school and it's always been a local go-to for good sushi. The quality of the food and service have always been consistent every time I have stopped in. 

I've tried a number of their rolls and none have disappointed. The pricing seems to be pretty average as far as sushi goes. The space is pretty small with maybe five booths and a few seats at the sushi bar. But it seems that this place gets a lot of takeout orders because every time I'm in, there are plenty of people coming and going. Personally, I like dining in because it's so quiet and peaceful. In addition to fresh and flavorful sushi, the service is always fast. They usually have our food out to us in no time at all.

Unfortunately I don't live nearby anymore so I don't get to stop in quite as often. But when I'm in the mood for sushi in the South Hills area, Sushi 3 is my top choice.",4,QnyzlVMyx0Exri-Lay10cA,0,5,2016-06-06,review,1

The staff is very friendly and casual. After so many years of eating there, they know my family and it is nice to remembered after having spent so much money there.

Our regular dishes of fried dumplings, chicken and broccoli, etc. are all well done standards of Chinese takeout. It may not be spectacular but it gets the job done.

When push comes to shove, Green Garden is an acceptable restaurant with great service. I will always be a regular (save something horrendous happens with one of our meals, but is hasn't happened yet).",0,81sqVj0xHyJXGYT0ip5fmQ,0,3,2012-10-14,review,0

I'll be back to order the massive dumplings again and again.

  The only notable ding I would give is the spicing. Both of our dishes are supposed to have a bit of spice flavor, and they are noted on the menu as spicy dishes, but there was a notable absence of spice.  There weren't even chilis in the Kung Pao sauce.  It's like someone forgot to spice the dishses.",0,81sqVj0xHyJXGYT0ip5fmQ,0,3,2014-06-03,review,0
_vS9qNQvx8wVUOIkj4qfAg,Qs1XuWRDFkxNYXAtGAeUJw,"I was in the mood for some Chinese and really wanted to try Red Tea House because I've heard really great things about it but they have strange delivery times and I was unable to pick the food up myself... so I opted for Green Garden instead.

I sampled vegetable egg foo young, hot & sour soup and bean curd with mixed vegetable. I received three generous eggy vegetable pancakes which had potential but unfortunately, they were left in the frier a little too long and soaked in a lot of excess grease. I think the accompanying sauce is actually beef gravy and bland (The great thing about eating at home is the opportunity to improvise...I whipped up a quick peanut sauce that went great with the egg foo young)

The hot and sour soup was decent, they use fresh mushrooms and the broth is a nice consistency (i.e. not too thick). The bean curd and veggies were nothing fancy, the veggies held some crunch and the curd had a palatable texture but was drowning in brown sauce. 

The food was piping hot and delivered fast.",1,81sqVj0xHyJXGYT0ip5fmQ,0,3,2014-08-17,review,1

lFj7E7ug7gL53ghtd0HzKQ,Clq650dLHmFTlRx2MO-bcQ,"Hate to give a middling review, but when I ordered from here I felt like the food was all over the place.  I've had much better ""fast food"" style Chinese food in more rural areas, so I felt disappointed by the lackluster performance of the meal.

The Good: The fried dumplings were amazing and while the wonton soup was strangely missing its green onions, it was still tasty. Actually, I'm thinking of always having my dumplings fried from now on like potstickers, because it really made my night.

The Bad: I ordered the classic General Tso's to get a good range of what they offered and Moo Goo Gai Pan, which is chicken and veggies in a white sauce (one of my favorite Chinese dishes). The food was...just ok. The General Tso's sauce was a bit too red in color but it was crispy like it should be and it tasted fine. The white sauce dish was sort of...off. I can't even explain it, but a couple of bites in I started hating the taste. The veggies were cooked well, but the chicken wasn't of a very high quality and my taste buds got turned off by the whole dish. These are classic dishes and if you can't get them right that worries me. My meal started going downhill around there.

The Ugly: I ordered both fried and steamed rice (again to get a good sampling), and the fried rice was bad. It was too brown, not really fried (just limp), and very sparse with a few carrots and peas and no scrambled egg bits (not de rigueur for delivery Chinese but I do love when fried rice has that in it). I'm not sure what happened - did they use new rice, or wet rice, or cooked it too long? Whatever it was, it was horrible. I might try to refry it tomorrow, but if it is still bad I'll probably just have to pitch it. 

The price for all of this was about the same for what I've paid for Chinese meals at restaurants and delivery places that I consider to be a little more ""upscale."" So I didn't think I was saving any money, and I was getting less quality for my troubles. There are several Asian places in the area that make great food, so I don't feel like I need to limit myself to this one.",0,81sqVj0xHyJXGYT0ip5fmQ,0,3,2016-01-13,review,0
